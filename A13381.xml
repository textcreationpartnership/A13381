            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As eche of theſe though deſired for priuate praiſe, and ſingled from others is a ſinguler ornament, ſo being ioyned with more of the reſt, and imployed to the publike good, cannot but make a man to be admired. But if al theſe together were inſpired into one as though all the planets had agreed by their gratious aſpects, and ſweete influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to furniſh a man at all aſſaies, would not the eyes of all mens minds be as it were dazeled at the bright beames of the right peereleſſe nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſuch a man? eſpecially if they ſhall ſee it wholly dedicated to the glory of God, the good of the Church and common wealth. I dare not apply this directly to your Honor, leaſt it may ſeeme to ſauour of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. But if it may pleaſe your wiſedome to ſuruay the excellent giftes, wherwith God hath ſingularly graced your honorable eſtate, if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that you haue imployed your wealth to the good of Gods Church, in this are you like the wiſe rulers of Iſrael, who freely offered precious ſtones, and coſtly perfumes to the worke of the tabernacle: ſo<pb facs="tcp:1872:3"/>farre as you haue vſed your honorable eſtate to countenance the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the profeſſors thereof, therein haue you reſembled the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Ioſeph, whom God exalted aboue all Pharaohs houſe, that ſo he might relieue his olde father Iſrael, and the families of all his brethren: wherein your Lordſhip hath vſed her Maieſties fauour to the building vp of the walles of Gods Church, therein haue you liuely repreſented the right noble Courtier Nehemiah, whoſe countenance was ſad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before Darius his king, vntill he had obtained letters, leaue, &amp; furniture, to repaire the walles of the holy Citie: So oft as your godly policies, graue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels, &amp; wiſe ſpeeches, haue directed for the peace of England, haue confounded the counſels of our Romiſh Achitophels, haue diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the treaſons of our Abſoloms, ſo often hath your Honor bin found faithfull to your Prince, to your Counrie, to the Church, as Huſhai the Archite Dauids friend. If by prayer and faſting you haue called for the helpe of God, as Ezra: if your hand haue bin as the hand of Ioab againſt the enemies of your Prince, and for the people of God in the loe countries: if you haue enlarged your heart and hand in gifts to many, who haue trauailed to benefite their countrie and profit the Church, as Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rewarded Hiram, &amp; thoſe who wrought al skilful workes for the Temple. If in all theſe things God haue inhabled your Lordſhip in ſome meaſure, or in moſt of them in great meaſure, to his glorie, the peace of the Church, the wealth of the land, and honor of the Prince, then both haue you wherein to reioyce, and the eies of all men whom to behold, as a common Patrone of all thoſe, who in any zealous deſire imploy their paynes to profite their countrey and the Church of God. Wherfore licenſed to diſpoſe (as I will) of this Engliſh worke made by Maſter Cyprian Lucar with a dutifull zeale to benefite his natiue ſoyle, I thought it my duetie to offer it to your noble patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, as a preſent moſt fit for your Honor, &amp; moſt profitable for theſe times.</p>
            <p>Your L. her Maieſties liefetenant in the loe countries hath endured great trauailes in the cauſe of God, and your Prince, and can any thing be more acceptable to your Honor than that which may be both for chiefe defence of the friends, and greateſt anoyance of the enemies of God and your Prince.

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>OST RENOWMED AND EXCEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent King, I haue been allured by queſtions which graue and wiſe men at ſundry tymes did aske of me, to conſider of many matters, and to knowe many thinges which I ſhould not haue knowne, nor thought, if the ſame queſtions had neuer beene demaunded. For it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my profesſion, nor at any time haue I delighted to ſhoote in an Harchibuſe, handegunne, or in any other ſmall or great peece of Artillerie, nor doe intende to ſhoote heereafter in any of them, but one onely queſtion which a skilfull Gunner in <hi>Anno Domini 1531.</hi> did aske of me in <hi>Verona,</hi> prouoked mee at that tyme to thinke therevpon, and by that occaſion to finde out the order and proportion of ſhootes at markes neare hand, and alſo at markes far of, according to the variable eleuation of the peece which doth ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, whereof I ſhould neuer haue had any care, if that Gunner had not with his ſaide queſtion ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee vp to deale in the ſame. Moreouer in <hi>Anno Domini 1537.</hi> It was reported that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> the Turkiſh Emperor made great preparation to war vppon the Chriſtians, wherefore I did write and publiſhe in haſte a ſhort Treatiſe of ſhooting in Gunnes to the ende that my deuiſes in the ſame might bee conſidered of, ſeene, and prooued whether or no they would be profitable for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Chriſtians. And although my ſaide booke did no good, and that I alſo made little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof becauſe as it happened the report of that war did afterwardes vade away like ſmeke, yet my ſaide booke made many wiſe men of great eſtimation, and alſo ſome of the common people, to trouble mee with other queſtions of Artillery, Pellets, Saltepeeter, and Powder, and to cauſe mee to enter againe into a deepe conſideration of their ſaide particular queſtions, whereby I founde out and knowe (as I haue ſaide before) many thinges of which (except the ſame queſtions had bin asked of me) I ſhould neuer haue had any Conſideration or knowledge. After this, thinking with my ſelfe that hee who hath by knowledge, labour, or chaunce inuented any notable thing doth merite great blame if hee will not impart his deuiſe vnto others (for if all our forefathers had kept their knowledge ſecrete from vs, wee ſhould at this time haue little differed from bruite beaſtes) I determined to be herein blameleſſe, and to publiſh the ſame queſtions or inuentions, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe haue now collected them out of one parte of my memoriall, in which I vſe for my better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce to write euery notable thing that I know. This collection is diuided into nine ſeuerall bookes according to the qualitie of the matter expreſſed in the ſame. And becauſe I do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that my Woorſhipfull Gosſippe M. <hi>Richad Ventuorth</hi> (who is one of your ſacred Maieſties Gentlemen) hath tolde me of the noble courage, liberalitie, roialty, humanity, and clemencie which are in your Highneſſe, and that your Excellencie delighteth much in all manner of warlike deuiſes, I am emboldened although I lacke the pithie eloquence and fine phraze of ſpeech which is meete for you to heare, to offer and dedicate vnto your Maieſtie the ſaide queſtions and my reſolute An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres vnto them, not as a conuenient thing for your Maieſtie (for inſomuch as the thinges of the moſt profoundeſt doctrine being expreſſed with eloquence and in a pure ſtile cannot come neere vnto the loweſt ſteppe of your Highneſſe, theſe our inuentions which are mecanicall and common things tolde and declared in a blunt and barbarous ſtile, may much leſſe approch vnto the ſame) but I doe offer and dedicate my ſaide inuentions vnto you as nwe thinges according to a cuſtome by which ſome vſe at the beginning of the yeare to preſent vnto noble and honorable perſons vnripe<pb facs="tcp:1872:4"/>and ſower fruites, not for that any goodneſſe is in them, but for daintie and newe thinges which doe naturallie pleaſe mens mindes: whereby I am perſwaded to thinke that though all my Inuentions ſhall not like you, yet ſome of them will delight you, which comming to paſſe as I deſire, will embolden mee to attempt hereafter more greater matters. At your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties feete lying proſtrate vppon the grounde with my head vncouered, and my handes ioyned togeather, I doe humblie recommend my ſelfe vnto your Highneſſe.</p>

                     <p>I am content to ſhewe vnto your Excellencie, an example of my ſaid inuention, but firſt I muſt ſpeake of that materiall inſtrument which I haue deuiſed &amp; ſet foorth in a picture at the beginning of my ſaid booke dedicated vnto you: the which inſtrument is made of a ſquare peece of wood or of mettall like vnto this figure B A C, and containeth a quadrant, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">How a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners quadrant may be made.</note> one fourth part of a circle like vnto the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure H I G K, which is to be deſcribed with a paire of compaſſes vpon the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter H, I meane one foote of the compaſſe ought to bee fixed in the point H the inward angle of the ſaid ſquare, and the other moueable foote of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pas muſt deſcribe I G K the crooked ſide or arke of that quadrant: alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther croked line equidiſtant from the firſt, as is the line E F, ought to be drawne with the ſaid compaſſes: but for this purpoſe the compaſſes may not bee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo wide as they were before, and all the ſpace which is betweene the two croked lines, that is to ſay, betweene the arke I G K, and the arke E F, muſt be deuided into 12. equal parts drawn by the edge of a ruler from the point H<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1872:6"/>the center of that Quadrant, ſo as euery of the ſame diuiſions (which I call points) may be perceiued to looke or lie right vpon that center H as they doe in this figure.</p>

                     <p>IN the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner euery of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid partes or points ſhould bee diuided into 12.<note place="margin">A Type of the Gunners qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant.</note> other equal parts: Although I haue not diuided this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure into ſo many parts, becauſe they would heere marre the ſame: but a Square of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie bigneſſe (as before I haue ſaid) may be ſo diuided, as that al the whol Square ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine 144. equall parts which I call minutes. Theſe minutes are to be marked with more ſhorter lines than are the lines of the points, to this end that they may be more eaſily nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred by the halfe or midſt of the points depicted with the greater lines, &amp; that we may alſo know how that euery point containeth twelue minutes. This done, a pinne of yron or of lattin is to bee fixed preciſely in the pointe H the center of the quadrant, and vpon that pinne a moueable threede of ſilke or of ſome other thing with a plummet at the end of the ſame muſt hang downe like vnto the perpendicular H M D.<note place="margin">The vſe of the Gunnets qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant.</note> This Inſtrument will help vs to iudge of all the variable poſitions or eleuations that may happen in any Peece of artillerie whatſoeuer. And nowe concerning the ſame poſitions or eleuations, this is to bee noted, that the firſt poſition of euery Peece is to bee vnderſtoode when it is laid leuell, for then (the longeſt legge of the ſaid inſtrument being put into the mouth of the ſaid Peece, and rightly extended towards the bottome of his concauitie) the threede and plummet which is fixed in the center of that inſtrument, will fall preciſely vpon the line H F K as it doth in the figure next following.</p>

                     <p>Alſo a Peece ſhall be ſaid to be eleuated two points, when the ſaid threede and plummet doth fall preciſely vpon the diuiſion of the ſecond point: and when the ſaid threede &amp; plummet doth fall preciſely vpon the third point, then the Peece is eleuated at three points: and ſo we muſt ſay of the fourth, fift, and ſixt points. But when a Peece is mounted at the ſixt point, then the ſaid Peece is mounted to the greateſt eleuation that it may be at. I ſpeake this of a Peece of Artillerie, becauſe the morter peeces may be eleuated vnto all the other points following: I meane euen vnto the 12. point. This which wee haue ſpoken of points, ought alſo to bee vnderſtood of minutes: that is to ſay, when a Peece is ſo mounted that the ſaid threed and plummet falleth Preciſely vpon the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt minute, that Peece ſhalbe ſaid to bee mounted one minute. And when the ſaid threed and plummet ſhall fall vpon the diuiſion of two minutes, it ſhall bee ſaid to bee mounted at two minutes. In like ſort it ſhall bee ſayd of all the reſt euen to the greateſt eleuation, that is to ſay, to the eleuation of the ſixt point, or of 72. minutes, as this figure next following doth manifeſtly ſhewe. The other minutes from thence to the end are for morter peeces,</p>

                     <speaker>Nicholas.</speaker>
                     <p>Hereupon I will firſt infer that a peece of Artillery mounted at one point ſhootes more farther than it will doe when it lyeth leuell, and that a piece mounted at two points will ſhoote more farther than at one point, and a piece mounted at three points will ſhoote more farther than at two points. Alſo a piece being mounted at 4. pointes, will ſhoote much more farther than it will do at 3. points. Likewiſe a peece mounted at 5. points, will ſhoote ſomwhat farther than at 4. points. And a peece moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at 6. points, ſhootes a pellet of leade a little farther than it doth at 5. points. For reaſon teacheth vs that the range of a pellet ſhot out of a peece mounted at 5 points, and the range of a like pellet ſhot out of the ſame peece mounted at 6. points doe ſo little differ, as that vpon any ſmall aduauntage happening either by force of powder, or by any other meanes, the peece being mounted at 5. points, will ſhoote ſo far as it can doe when it is mounted at 6. points, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce farther: but when one doth mount ſuch a peece, ſo as they doe mount morter peeces, that is to ſay at 7. points, with out doubt by mounting the peece at 7. points, he ſhall not ſhoote ſo far as he did when that peece was mounted at 6. points, alſo at the 8. Point, he ſhall not ſhoote ſo far as he did at the 7. point. Likewiſe at the 9. point he ſhal ſhoote much ſhorter than he did at the 8. point, &amp; at the 10. point he ſhall ſhoote leſſe ground than at the 9. point, &amp; ſo at the 11. point he ſhall ſhoote much ſhorter than at the 10. point, finally at the
12. and laſt point he ſhall not ſhoote ſo far by a great deale as hee did at the 11. point. But in this laſt eleuation it may be thought, that by naturall reaſon the pellet ſhould returne backe againe into the mouth of the peece, yet by many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which do commonly happen in that inſtant when the peece is diſcharged, the Pellet will not preciſely returne into the very mouth of the peece, but fall downe neare vnto the ſame.</p>

                     <p>Suppoſe for an example that it doth ſo fall out that you muſt batter a fort, which is on the top of a hill, being 60. paces high, and that at 100. paces diſtant from the ſaid hil, there is another hill of 60. paces in height, which is equall in height with the ſaid fort as it may appeare by the figure next following. And ſuppoſe that vpon the top of this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hill you may commodiouſly plant artillerie to batter the ſaid fort, and to ſhoote leuel with your artillerie from thence againſt that fort, as it may alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the ſaide figure next following.

                     <p>To declare this well, and that I may bee the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, I am compelled to ſet downe firſt the definitions of ſome fit tearmes,<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1872:8"/>and alſo ſome ſuppoſitions, as the vſe is to doe in euerie Science, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thinges will bee better vnderſtoode by an Example than by wordes, I will ſuppoſe for an Example that A.B. is a paire of Ballance with two armes A.C. and C.B. which are of a like length, and of an equall waight, and that the point C. is the center vpon which the ſaid beame or armes do turne, &amp; that two bodies of equall waighte named by theſe two letters A. and B doe hang at the endes of the ſaid armes. The which two bodies being ſuppoſed to bee of equall waight, and to hang at an equall length vppon the ſaide two armes A.C. and C. B. of the ſuppoſed ballance which are alſo ſuppoſed to bee of one luſt length, by the firſt peticion aleaged by <hi>Archimedes</hi> in his booke which hee made of the center of waightes, ſhoulde incline equally, that is to ſay, they ſhoulde ſtande ſtraight outright, ſo as one ende of that beame doe lie no higher than the other, as it may appeare by the figure next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.

And for example of this propoſition, let the ballance A B (of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure precedent) be turned vppon the ſaid center C, and let the ſame two equall bodies A and B hanging or ioyning to the two endes of the two armes of the ſaid ballance, be in the ſame place of equalitie (as aboue was ſuppoſed) nowe I ſay that remouing the one and the other of the ſaid bodies from the ſaid place of equalitie (that is to ſay, one end of the ſaid beame, or of one of the ſaid armes being put downe, and the other end of the ſaid beame, or of the ſaid other arme<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1872:9"/>being eleuated) the one and the other of thoſe two bodies ſhall bee thereby made the more lighter, and they ſhall be by ſo much the more lighter, by howe much they are the more farther from the ſaid place of equalitie. <label type="milestone">

                              <p>Howbeit in this figure the one and the other of theſe two Arkes is deuided but into three equall partes in the pointes L N and Q S, and from the three pointes N L I, drawe the three lines N O, L M, and I K equidiſtant from the diameter B A, the which will cut E F the line of direction in three points Z Y X. Likewiſe from the three points Q S V. drawe three lines Q P, S R, and V T equidiſtant from the ſayde lyne A B, the which likewiſe will cut the ſaide line of direction in three pointes <hi>&amp;</hi> ♄ ♃ and ſo the whole deſcent A V made with the ſaide bodye A deſcended into the poynte V, is deuided into three deſentes or equall partes the which are A Q, Q S and S V, likewiſe the whole deſcent I B which is made with the ſaide bodie B in deſcending or returning to his firſt place (that is to ſaye in the pointe B) ſhall bee deuided into three equall partes, the which are I L, L N, and N B. And euery of theſe three and three partes or deſcentes doe take one parte of the line of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that is to ſaye, the deſcent from A to Q doth take from the line of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection the parte C <hi>&amp;,</hi> the deſcent <hi>Q</hi> S doth take the parte <hi>&amp;</hi> ♄, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent S V doth take the parte ♄ ♃.

Likewiſe becauſe the part ♄ ♃ of the line of direction is leſſe than the part <hi>&amp;</hi> ♄, the deſcent S V by the ſaid ſecond ſuppoſition ſhall bee more oblique than the deſcent Q S. And conſequently by the ſaid firſt ſuppoſition the ſaid bodie A ſhall be more lighter in the point S, than it ſhall bee in the point <hi>Q.</hi> And all this in the ſelfe-ſame maner maye bee demonſtrated by the oppoſite parte of the bodie B. That is to ſay, the deſcent of it from the poynt I to the poynt L, is more oblique than that which is from the point L to the poynt N by the ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde ſuppoſition. Therefore the parte X Y which is taken out of the line of direction, is leſſe than the parte Y Z. Wherefore by the ſaide firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, the ſaide bodie B hanging at the poynt I, is more lighter than when it doth hang at the poynt L, and by the ſame reaſon it ſhall bee more lighter when it hanges at the poynt L than when it hanges at the poynt N. Likewiſe it ſhall bee more lighter when it doth hang at the poynt N than when it hanges at the poynte B the place of equalitie which is the thing that was propoſed.</p>

                     <p>It commeth ſo to paſſe becauſe that eleuation of 6, points doth differ much from the place of equalitie, and according as the Peece is eleuated from minute to minute,<note place="margin">According as a Peece is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated from minute to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, or from point to point: ſo from minute to minute, and from point to point the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of that Peece doth augment his range in an inſenſible croked line.</note> ſo from minute to minute the pellet of that peece doth augment his raunge in a right line: it doth alſo the like in the points, but that is in a greater quantitie.

                     <p>Now to returne to our purpoſe, I ſay that if the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſaid fortreſſe, and the Peece lying on the plaine at the foote of the hil be
760. paces, and that the diſtance betweene the ſame fortreſſe and the peece lying on the toppe of the ſaid hill be but 130 paces, in this caſe the ſaid Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which is planted on the toppe of the hill will doe a greater exploit againſt the walles of that fortreſſe, than that Culuering ſhall do which is planted on the plaine at the foote of the ſaid hill: the cauſe hereof is, for that the ſaid Culuering lying leuell, doth ſhoote about 200. paces in a right line as before hath bin ſaid. Then for ſo much as the diſtance betweene that Culuering and the Fortreſſe is but 130 paces (as it hath bin ſuppoſed) the pellet of that Culuering will ſtrike the walles of that Fortreſſe neare about 70 paces before it would end his range in a right line, but the Culuering which is planted on the plaine at the foote of the hill being diſtant from thoſe walles 760 paces in a diametral line, and eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to 45 degrees (that is to ſay, to the 6 point of our quadrant) doth ſhoote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 800 paces in a right line, and therefore it will ſtrike thoſe walles onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40 paces before it would ende his way in a right line, or be ſenſibly percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to decline.<note place="margin">In the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propoſed in this Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie the pellet which at his hitting would haue gon moſt fartheſt (not meeting with an obiect to reſiſt it) ſhall do the greateſt exploit vpon that obiect which reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</note> And ſo that pellet which at his hitting would haue gon moſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt (not meeting with an obiect to reſiſt it) ſhall doe the greateſt exploit vpon that obiect which reſiſteth, by the reaſons alleaged vppon the fourth propoſition of our firſt booke of our nwe ſcience. Therefore inſomuch as the pellet of that Culuering which is planted on the top of the hill at the hitting of thoſe walles had to flie more farther about 70 paces in a right line, and that the pellet of that Culuering which is planted on the plaine at the foote of the hill at his hitting, had to flie more farther but onely about 40 paces in a right line, I conclude in this caſe by thoſe reaſons, that the pellet of that Culuering which is planted on the top of the hill ſhall do a greater exploit againſt thoſe walles than the pellet of that Culuering which is planted on the plaine at the foote of the hil, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated to the ſixth poynt of our quadrant. And if the pellet of this Culuering mounted to the ſixt poynt be of a leſſe force, the pellet of that peece mounted at any other poynt vnder the 6 poynt is of much leſſer force. But if the diſtance from the ſaid Fortreſſe vnto the Artillerie on the plaine had bin 600 paces in a diametrall line,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and that from the Fortreſſe vnto the Artillerie on the toppe of the hill it had bin 150 paces, the Artillerie on the plaine mounted to the 6 poynt would haue ſtroken thoſe walles with more force than the Artillerie vpon the top of the hill could haue done: for the pellets ſhot out of the Artillerie on the plaine will beate thoſe walles about 200 paces before the full ende of their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in a right line, and the pellets of the Artillery on the top of the hil will beate thoſe walles 50 paces before the end of their full courſe in a right line. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the difference of the ſaide effects that is from 50. paces to 200. paces, (which they make before they do ſenſibly decline) is about 150. paces, and therefore the ſaid Culuering not onely at the eleuation of the ſixt poynt of our quadrant, but alſo at the eleuation of the fift point doth make that effect to be more greater. But concerning this I will not ſtand to make any demonſtration for that I will not be tedious vnto you. Then if in ſo great a height (as in the 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1872:10"/>laſt caſe we haue ſuppoſed) the Culuering vpon the plaine being mounted to the ſixt point, and alſo to the fift point will do a more greater exploit than the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering vpon the toppe of the hill, ſuch great effects will much more euidently follow in the firſt caſe which was propoſed by your Excellencie, where the hill and alſo the Fortreſſe were ſuppoſed to be of equall height, and each of them to be 60 paces in height, and the diſtance from the foote of one hill to the foote of the other, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of the one hil to the top of the other to be 100 paces, &amp; the Diametrall or Diagonall line, that is to ſay the diſtance from the ſaide For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe to the place at the foote of the hill, where the Artillerie is ſuppoſed to ſtand on the plaine, by the 47 propoſition of the firſt booke of <hi>Euclide</hi> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 116 paces leauing out the Fraction which ſhould be added vnto that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) and therefore the pellet ſhot out of the Culuering which is planted on the toppe of the hill will ſtrike thoſe walles about 140 paces before the full end of his range in a right line, &amp; the pellets of the Artillerie which is planted on the plaine at the foote of the hill and mounted to the 6 point wil ſtrike thoſe walles about 684 paces before the full end of their ranges in a right line.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And becauſe here is ſo great a difference in that one of thoſe pellets doth hit the fortreſſe 140 paces before the full end of his range in a right line, and the other pellet doth hit the ſame fortreſſe 684 paces before the full end of his range in a right line, therefore in this queſtion it is a plaine and euident thing, that the Culuering planted on the plaine at the foote of the hill mounted to the 6 point, 5 point, or to any other point of eleuation, wil do a greater exploit againſt the ſaid fortreſſe than that Culuering will doe which is planted on the top of the hill.</p>

                     <p>I graunt this, that ſhooting right vp towardes Heauen, or right downe towards the center of the world, the pellet doth flye altogether in a right line, and alſo that in both thoſe waies the pellet doth flye much more in a right line, than at any other eleuation of the peece, or in any other way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer: but I do not beleeue for it is vnlikely, that in all other waies except in thoſe two, the pellet doth in no part of his way flie in a right line, for if you doe well remember,<note place="margin">Verona is a Cittie in Italie in the country called Marchia Taruiſina.</note> you haue told me that by two ſhootes prooued in <hi>Verona,</hi> you fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the ſaid Culuering lying leuel, &amp; carrying a pellet of 20 pound waight, ſhot at point blanke, that is to ſay in a right line (as you iudged) about

                     <p>Now to conclude our ſayde purpoſe wee will ſuppoſe that all the range which the pellet being ſhot our of the Culuering may make or hath made, is all the line A B C D. And if it be poſſible for any part thereof to be perfectly right, I will ſuppoſe the ſame part to be A B, and diuide the ſame part into two equall partes in the point E. and becauſe the pellet will flye more ſwiftly in the ſpace A E (by the third propoſition of the firſt booke of our nwe ſcyence) than in the ſpace E B, therefore the ſaid pellet doth flye more right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye (by the reaſons afore alleaged) in the ſpace A E, than it doth in the ſpace E B. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the line A E, ſhall be a more ſtraighter lyne than E B,<note place="margin">The one part of a right line cannot be more or leſſe right than the other part.</note> the which is a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For if all the whole line A B be ſuppoſed to be a perfect right line, the one halfe thereof cannot be more or leſſe right than the other halfe, and if the one halfe of that line ſhould bee more righter than the other, it would of neceſſitie follow that the other halfe ſhould not be right, and therefore of neceſſitie it followeth that the part E B is not perfectly right.</p>

                     </figure>
                     <p>And if any man be of this opinion, that the part A E is a perfect right line, his ſaid opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion may be reprooued for falſe by deuiding the ſayd part A E into two equall partes in the poynt F, and then by the reaſons aboue alleaged it will be manyfeſt that the part A F is more righter than the part F E, ſo that the ſaide part F E of neceſſitie cannot be perfectly right. Likewiſe by diuiding the part A F into two equall parts, it is manifeſt by the ſame reaſons, that that halfe therof which is next to A is more righter than that which is next to F and ſo by diuiding that halfe into two other equall parts it will follow that the part ending in A is more righter than the other part. And becauſe theſe proceedings are infinite, it followeth of neceſſitie that not onely all the part A B is not perfectly ſtraight, but that no part therof (howe little ſoeuer it bee) can bee perfectly ſtraight, which is that which was required to be prooued. Then it is to be ſeene how that the pellet ſhot out of that Culuering in ſuch ſort, doth not flye in any part of his range in a perfect right line, although it doth flie as ſwiftly as may be deſired,<note place="margin">The more ſwif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter a pellet doth flie, the leſſe crooked is his range.</note> becauſe the ſwiftneſſe (how great ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be) is neuer ſufficient in ſuch ſort to make the pellet flye in a right line. But this is true, the more ſwifter that the pellet doth flye, the more nearer it doth approch to flie in a right line, and yet it will neuer be made to flye in a right line. Therefore it is more conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to ſay in ſuch a caſe, that the more ſwifter the pellet doth flie, the leſſe crooked is his range.</p>

But ſuch effectes doe not come for that the pellet flyeth in a rght lyne, or for that it doth aſcende aboue that rightneſſe, but they come wholie by reaſon of the ſayde ſightes or markes through which the leuell is taken.

Yet when a pellet is ſhot out of a peece ſomwhat eleuated at the mouth, I do think &amp; verily beleeue, that the pellet wil range through the aire for a while in a right line, becauſe the waight of ſuch a pellet ſhot out of a peece eleuated at the mouth, is leſſe apt to make that pellet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards the ground, than when it is ſhot out of a peece lying leuel.</p>

                     <p>It is truth (as your Excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy doth ſay) that the waight of a pellet is not ſo apt to hinder the range of the ſame when the pellet flyeth out of a peece eleuated, as when the ſaid pellet flieth out of a peece which lieth equidiſtant to the <hi>Horizon,</hi>

For the peece being eleuated by degrees, the ſaid waight alſo by degrees doth goe nearer towards his ſaid waie or paſſage, that is to ſay, it doth not fall there ſo perpedicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larlie from the ſayd paſſage, but comes alwaies more neare vnto the ſame, and ſo is of leſſe ſtrength and force to drawe the pellet out of his waie or paſſage, beſides this (as before hath bin declared) by how much a peece is more eleuated, by ſo much the range of his pellet is leſſe crooked, and yet the range of that pellet cannot in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part thereof be perfectly right, except in the two waies before ſpecified, that is to ſay, when it is ſhot directly vp towardes heauen, or directly downe towardes the center of the world: Becauſe in euery other waie ſome part of the waight drawes alwaies the ſaid pellet out of his waie or paſſage, except in the aforeſaid two waies that is to ſay, directly vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen, or directly downe towards the center of the world: in which two waies, the ſaid waight (if any waight be there) drawes the pellet right according to the order of his paſſage or waie and not out of the ſame as by this figure you may eaſily without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demonſtration perceaue. And ſo it is in ſhootes flying downewardes aſwell as in ſhoots flying vpwardes, ſuppoſing A to be the mouth of the peece out of which B the pellet iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth, &amp; in the forme of a perpendicular, C to be the waight of that pellet B: the which perpendicular or waight C doth alwaies drawe the pellet towardes the center of the worlde that is to ſay, downe towardes the grounde. Whereuppon by reaſoning as we haue done of ſhoots made in a right line, it wil be manifeſt, that a pellet ſhot out of a Culuering or out of any other peece, cannot goe in any ſmall part of his range in a perfect right line, except in the two waies aforeſaide, which is that which was required to bee prooued.</p>

Now for that the pellet is not expelled or driuen forth with any other thing than by the airie exhalation or wind cauſed through the ſaltpeter, therfore by making ſuch a peece co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually more attractiue as I haue ſaid with that more heate which ſuppeth &amp; retaineth continually more of that wind which ſhould ſerue to expell the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, the virtue expulſiue in that peece doth continually more decreaſe, &amp; the pellet by that reaſon flieth with leſſe ſwiftnes or leſſe force, and conſequently maketh continually a leſſe or ſhorter range.</p>

                     <p>I like wel of your reaſons, but who doth not know that the two firſt accidents which giue furtherance and aide to the range of the pellet (I meane the great combuſtion or running of the aire towards the place which is continually ſhot at, and the force which increaſeth in the powder through the heate) are ſufficient, &amp; perchance more than enough to ſupplie that attractiue defect cauſed by the great heate of the peece? The which thing being ſo, it foloweth that the ſame peece ſhooteth alwaies in one like ſort, that is to ſay, it ſhooteth no farther at onetime than at an other, becauſe that which the ſaid two accidents adde therunto, is ſo much as that which the third accident doth diminiſh, or elſe it ſhootes continually more farther, for that the increaſe of the ſaide two firſt accidentes is more than the detraction of the third accident.</p>

And when it is ſaid that both the leuell ſights are of an equall height, you muſt vnderſtand thereby that the extreames or toppes of the ſayde leuell ſights are equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the loeſt part or ground of the concauitie in the peece, for the height of the leuell ſightes, and alſo the loneſſe or ſhortneſſe of the leuell ſights, muſt alwaies be meaſured from the loeſt part or ground of the concauitie in the Canon of the peece. And when the leuell ſights vpon a peece are of an equall height, and he that ſhoots doth ſee his mark by the tops of thoſe leuel ſights, then by how much more farther the ſaid marke is from the peece, by ſo much the pellet will ſtrike more vnder the mark. And when the leuell ſight which is ſet vpon the mouth of the peece is more higher than the leuell ſight, which is ſet vppon the taile of the peece, and he which ſhootes doth ſee his marke by the toppes of thoſe leuel ſights, the pellet wil ſtrike more vnder that marke than it will do when both the leuell ſights are of an equal height. And when our viſual line in ſeeing our marke doth cut the line in which the pellet flieth, then the leuel ſight at the mouth of the peece is more ſhorter than it ſhould be. And when our viſual line in ſeeing our mark doth not cut nor touch the line in which the pellet flieth, then the leuel ſight at the mouth of the peece is not ſo ſhort as it ſhould be.

                     <p>All this commeth to paſſe by reaſon of the leuell ſights that are vpon the peece.

Nowe I ſay that of neceſsitie in this caſe the pellet will alwayes ſtrike ſomewhat more vnder that mark, be the marke as farre or as neere to the Peece as you will, becauſe our viſual line (which the line C D E doth repreſent) proceedeth alwayes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelf in an equall diſtance from the concauitie of the Peece, or rather fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the line which is produced in a right length according to the order of the concauitie in the Peece, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the center of that concauitie, which in this caſe we will ſuppoſe to be the line F G, and therefore the point G muſt of neceſsitie be more loer than the point E by ſo much as the center of the concauitie in the canon of the Peece is loer than the point D. And hereby it may appeare, that if the pellet ſhould flie in a perfect right line, it would ſtrike in this caſe vnder the mark, that is to ſay, in the point G.

                     <p>That is by reaſon of the condition and qualitie of the ſtroke, which happeneth when the two leuell ſights are of equall height: and alſo when the leuel ſight at the mouth of the Peece is more higher than the leuell ſight vppon the breech of the Peece: that is to ſay, in the one &amp; in the other of them, the pellet hits alwaies of neceſsitie vnder the marke. Now reſteth only that I ſhould declare the condition and quallitie of the ſtroke that may happen when the leuel ſight at the mouth of the Peece is ſomewhat ſhorter than the leuel<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1872:15"/>ſight which is on the taile of the Peece,<note place="margin"> 
                           <p>The loneſſe or ſhortnes of the leuel ſights vpon a Peece, muſt alwaies bee meaſured as the height of the ſame ought to bee meaſured that is to ſay, from the vndermoſt part or ground of the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie in the canon of that Peece.</p> 
                           <p>When our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall line in ſeeing our mark doth cut the line in which the pellet ſheth, then the leuell ſight at the mouth of the Peece is more ſhorter than it ſhoulde bee.</p> 
                           <p>When our viſuall line in ſeeing our marke doth not cut nor touch the line in which the pellet ſheth, then the leuell ſight at the mouth of the Peece is not ſo ſhort as it ſhould be.</p>
                        </note> and this loneſſe or ſhortneſſe ought alwayes to be meaſured (as before hath been declared) from the vndermoſt part or ground of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauitie in the canon of that Peece. Therefore I ſay that when the leuell ſight at the mouth of the Peece ſhall be ſomewhat more ſhorter than the leuell ſight which is on the breeche of the Peece, it may chaunce that ſometimes the pellet will ſtrike in the middle of the marke, and ſometimes aboue the marke, and ſometimes vnder the marke at which you ſhoote.</p>

                     <p>By this reaſon. When the leuell ſight at the mouth of the Peece is ſhorter than the leuel ſight which is on the breech of the Peece, then alwayies by the fift petition of <hi>Euclide</hi> our viſuall line doth of neceſsitie meet with the right line which proceedeth ſtraight foorth according to the vndermoſt part of the concauitie in the Peece, and for that the way in which the pellet flieth for a good ſpace togeather is neare vnto it or not farre from it, although it bee not ſtraight nor goeth in truth by the ſaide line which proceedeth ſtraight foorth according to the vndermoſt part of the concauitie in the canon of that Peece. And therefore that interſection may be in ſuch a place where the ſame viſuall line will alſo cut the line or way in which the pellet flieth. And this commeth to paſſe when the leuell ſight at the mouth of the Peece is more ſhorter than it ſhould be in reſpect of the leuell ſight which is on the breeche of the Peece. And that interſection may be alſo in ſuch a place wher the ſaid viſual line wil not cut nor touch the ſaid line or way in which the pellet flieth. And this hapneth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leuel ſight at the mouth of the Peece is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly enough more ſhorter than the leuel ſight which is on the breech of the Peece. Alſo that interſection may bee in ſuch a place where the viſual line wil touch the line or way in which the pellet flieth,<note place="margin">When our viſual line in ſeeing the marke doth touch or cut the line in which the pellet flieth, and the marke at which wee ſhoote is in the ſaid touch point, or in the ſaid point of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, then the leuel ſight at the mouth of the Peece hath his due length and conuenient ſhortneſſe, and the pellet will ſtrike in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the marke. But when the ſaide marke ſhall be within that touch point or point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſection, then the pellet will hit ſomewhat vnder that marke, and when the ſaid marke ſhal be without that touch point or point of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the the pellet wil hit aboue the ſaid mark.</note> &amp; this happeneth when the leuel ſight at the mouth of the peece hath his due and conuenient ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in reſpect of the leuel ſight which is on the breech of the Peece, and then if by chaunce our viſual line ſhall cut the ſaid line or way of the pellet, and by chaunce the marke vnto which the leuel is giuen, ſhall be preciſely in the point of that interſection, without doubt the pellet will ſtrike preciſely in the midſt of that marke: but if by chaunce the ſaid marke ſhall be within that interſection, that is to ſay, more towardes the peece, then the pellet wil alwaies hit ſomwhat vnder the mark I meane vnder the midſt of it, and by how much the more remote or farther of the ſame mark ſhalbe from that interſection, that is to ſay, more towards the Peece, by ſo much the pellet will hit more vnder the middle part of that mark.

                     <p>Let vs ſuppoſe by the figure folowing,<note place="margin">Example.</note> that a Peece of Artillery hath vpon it 2 leuell ſights marked with theſe letters C and D, &amp; that D the leuel ſight, is ſhorter tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the leuel ſight C, &amp; that F G is the line which proceedeth ſtraight foorth according to the order of the vndermoſt part or ground of the concauitie in the Peece, &amp; that H I is the line or way in which the pellet flieth, &amp; that our viſual line proceeding ſtraight foorth by the tops or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt points of the two leuel ſights C and D, doth of neceſsity (as hath bin before ſaid) cut the line FG, and therefore let vs ſuppoſe that our ſaid viſual line doth alſo cut the ſaid line H I in the point K as it doth in the figure folowing. Now I ſay that if the marke to which the leuel is giuen, be preciſely in the point K, the pellet will ſtrike preciſely in the middle of that mark. And if by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the ſaid marke be within that interſection, that is to ſay, towards the Peece, as if I ſhould ſay in the point M, the pellet will alwaies ſtrike ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vnder the midſt of that mark, becauſe in al that ſpace the pellet rangeth alwaies vnder our viſual line. And by how much the ſaid mark is more remote or farther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the point K, that is to ſay,<note place="margin">Note.</note> by how much more nearer M is to the peece, by ſo much the pellet wil ſtrike<pb facs="tcp:1872:15"/>more loer: neuertheles ſuch loneſſe in ſuch a caſe can neuer be equal to the difference that is betweene the extreame or vppermoſt part of the leuell ſight which is vppon the mouth of the peece, I meane betweene the point D and the center of the ſaid concauitie or holloneſſe in the peece: the which difference is about one halfe part of the thickneſſe of the peece in the breech: and therefore when the marke to which the leuell is giuen, lieth betweene the Peece and that interſection, the Gunner is ſubiect to a ſmall error by reaſon of the leuel ſights. But when ſuch a marke is ſomewhat without that interſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if I ſhould ſay in the point L, the pellet will ſtrike aboue the marke, becauſe for a long way or ſpace the pellet flieth aboue the viſuall line. And therefore by how much the ſaide marke is more farther from the point K, by ſo much the ſtroke of the pellet in a long way will hit the more higher.<note place="margin">When a pellet in his range ſhal cut our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual line &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend aboue the ſame line, then of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie the ſame pellet in his deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding will cut the ſaid line againe. When our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual line doth cut the line of the pellet, then of neceſsitie it muſt cut the ſame in two places, &amp; the firſt of thoſe two places can not bee very far from the peece, but the other place of interſection muſt of neceſsitie be very far from the peece, I meane in the end of the pellets violent range.</note> And it is true that the pellet going farre in his croked or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall way, returneth to cut againe our viſual line, becauſe our viſual line C D K L doth infinitely proceede ſtraight foorth, and the pellet doth not infinitely proceed in the way H K I, but in time beginneth to decreaſe and encline towards the center of the worlde, and finally finding no reſiſtance directeth it ſelfe in his naturall way towards the ſaid cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the worlde, and ſo by going farre it doth of neceſsitie returne to cut againe our viſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all line in his way: and therefore if the ſaid marke be very farre of, that is to ſay, ſo much beyond the firſt interſection made in the point K, as that by chaunce it is alſo preciſely in the other ſecond interſection, without doubt in that place which is ſo farre of, the pellet will ſtrike preciſely in the middeſt of the marke, for that at all times when our viſuall line doth cut the way of the pellet, it is neceſſary that it doe cut it in two places, the one of which, that is to ſay, the firſt, can not be very farre from the Peece: but the other, that is to ſay, the ſecond interſection muſt of neceſsitie be very farre from the Peece, I meane that it muſt be in the ende of the violent randge of the pellet: and ſometimes that may bee in his naturall mouing or way, and therefore in this caſe when the marke at which the leuel is giuen is in any of the ſaid two places or interſections, the pellet will neceſſarily ſtrike in the very middle of the marke.</p>

                     <p>In the figure following for example ſake,<note place="margin">How a Gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nar may at one ſhoot with one pellet ſtrike 2 diuers markes in two ſeuerall places.</note> a Peece of Artillery is drawne with two leuel ſights noted with the letters C and D according as it hath been propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that is to ſay, the leuel ſight D is ſo much ſhorter than the leuel ſight C, as that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our viſuall line will cut the way in which the pellet flieth. And let all the line H I K L M repreſent the whole way in which the pellet finding no reſiſtance hath or ſhall violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly randge. And let the line M N bee a part of the naturall range which the pellet hath or ſhal make.

And by how much more the ſaid mark is beyond the ſayd point K towards the point L, by ſo much the pellet will ſtrike the leſſe aboue that marke. But when the ſaide marke is ſomewhat beyonde the point L, the pellet of neceſsitie wil ſtrike vnder the marke, and when the marke ſhall be much beyond the point L, the pellet cannot flie vnto the marke as by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon this may in my opinion bee eaſily vnderſtood.</p>

But it is true that in the ſaid line of the pellets way, there is one certaine place at which our viſual line doth come more nearer to the ſaid way than in any other place, and therefore if by chaunce the mark vnto which the leuel is giuen ſhal happen to be ſet in that place although the pellet wil ſtrike there vnder that mark, yet this notwithſtanding the pellet wil ſtrike at that place more nearer vnto the mark than in any other place.<note place="margin">Example.</note> As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in the figure of a peece of artillery here vnder drawne, let the two leuel ſights of that Peece be noted with theſe letters C and D, and let the line or way of the pellet be noted with theſe letters H I K, and let the leuel ſight on the mouth of the peece<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1872:16"/>noted with the letter D, bee ſomewhat more ſhorter than the leuell ſight on the breeche noted with this letter C, but in ſo ſmal a quantitie that the viſual line which ſhal go by the extreamees or toppes of thoſe leuel ſights in the line C D M L, do not touch the ſaid line or way of the pellet H I K.

But the touch point cannot be but in one place only, the which place is more farther from the mouth of the Peece than any other place whatſoeuer, where our viſuall line may meete with the line of way in which the pellet flieth. Then that being a more longer or farther concourſe and leſſe variable than any of the other concourſes which doe cut the ſame, I thinke for this reaſon that ſuch a dignitie ought more worthily to bee giuen to that touch point than to any of the points of interſection.</p>

                     <p>It is not ſo my Lorde, but it is as I haue told you, and to the ende that this may bee proued to be true by reaſon. I doe ſuppoſe for example ſake that the peece in the figure folowing hath on his breech a leuell ſight noted with this letter C ſet ſomewhat without the point of the midſt &amp; towards the right hand, and that the leuell ſight D which is at the mouth of the Peece is ſet iuſt in the point of the middeſt, and that the point E is the marke vnto which the leuel is giuen by the ſaid two leuell ſights, the which point E muſt needes bee wide, &amp; towardes the left ſide from the line F G, which is ſuppoſed to be the way of the pellet, as it doth appeare to bee in the figure following. Then this point or marke E be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the left ſide wide of the pellets way, it followeth that the way of the pellet lieth wide from the ſame marke, and towardes the right ſide thereof as by the figure following which is made for an example you may perceaue. And ſuch effect would much more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe if D the leuell ſight on the mouth of the Peece were alſo without the ſame pointe of the middeſt towardes the other ſide, that is to ſay, towardes the left ſide.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond cauſe of ſuch effect or inconuenience may come through the concauitie of the peece which often times is not bored or caſt right in the middeſt of the mettall. I meane that the ſame concauitie or hole is not in the verie middeſt of the mettall, but makes one ſide of the peece to be more thinner or thicker than the other ſide, ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the two leuell ſightes be well ſet and perfectly placed in the verie middell pointes vpon the vppermoſt part of the mettal, yet that peece muſt needs ſhoot wide, for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the leuell ſightes are placed in the verie middle points vpon the vppermoſt parte of the mettall yet they doe not ſtande right ouer the middell of the concauitie of that peece, and for that cauſe ſuch a peece ſhootes wide. Wherefore to remedie this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience it is neceſſarie to ſearch aduiſedly for the verie middle of the concauitie as well in the taile of the Peece, as in the mouth of the ſame, and to place the leuell ſightes ouer the middle of the ſame concauitie for to amende that fault in the Peece.<note place="margin">

                        </note> To finde the middle of the ſame concauitie the Gunners vſe (as I haue been informed) two long Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or ſmall ſtaues verie right and of equall breadth, and doe put one of them right into the concauitie, and downe to the bottome of the ſame, and the other without vpon the Peece, and they ioyne one part of that Ruler which is aboue the Peece to the Ruler that goeth into the mouth of the Peece in that part thereof which is without the mouth of the ſame, and ſo where they finde the very middle of the concauitie to bee, there right ouer the ſame vpon the outſide and vppermoſt part of the Peece they doe place in the taile of the Peece, and at the mouth of the Peece the two leuell ſightes.

                     <p>No: and yet I beleeue that this is true which I haue tolde you, for all Gunners generally are of that opininion, and it cannot bee otherwiſe, for the hollowe Cylinder of the Culuering being more longer than the hollowe Cylinder of the Cannon, and charged with a more quantitie of powder than the Cannon, it muſte needes bee that the Culueringe will ſhoote farther than the Cannon. And the coſt thereof is not ſo great as you thinke it to bee. for a Canon whoſe Pellet waygheth twentie pounde waight, is commonly charged with thirteene poundes and foure ounces of powder, and the Culuering whoſe pellet waigheth twentie pounde<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1872:18"/>waight is commonly charged with ſixteene pound waight of powder, which is but two pound and eight ounces more of powder than is due for the charge of a Canon, ſo that the coſt of two pound and eight ounces of powder (which is the exceſſe) is but a trifle.</p>

                     <p>I will not affirme that the Culuering ſhall ſhoote more or leſſe grounde than the Canon, for this matter is not very plaine vnto me hauing no perfect knowledge of his proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned length, as before I haue ſaid, but this is true,<note place="margin">A Culuering being charged with no more powder than with the due charge of a Canon wil not ſhoot ſo much ground as a Canon wil do.</note> that the Culuering charged with no more powder than with the due charge of a Canon, wil not ſhoote ſo much ground as a Canon wil do. And I am certaine that he which wil ſhoot with a Culuering ſo much ground as he may doe with a Canon, muſt needes put into that Culuering more powder than is vſed to be put into a Canon. And he ſhall haue need of ſo much more powder as the difference betweene the two ſhootes made with an equall or like quantitie of powder ſhalbe more greater. And therefore I conclude that when a Culuering whoſe pellet waigheth twentie pounde waight, is diſcharged with no more powder than is the ordinarie charge of a Canon, it may bee eaſily perceaued that the ſame quantitie of powder is not ſufficient to make the Culuering ſhoote ſo much grounde as a Canon will doe which is charged and diſcharged with the like quantitie of the ſame powder.<note place="margin">Note.</note> But it may be that they which did firſt appoint for the charge of the Culuering ſo much powder as waigheth ⅘ partes of his pellets waight, haue perchance vpon their experience ſet downe that proportion to make the Culuering ſhoote ſo much grounde and perhaps more than the Canon can doe. But this thing may not be graunted nor denied before proofe hath beene made thereof: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe be it as you will, if the ſayd Culuering charged with the ſame quantitie of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which chargeth a Canon, ſhooteth not ſo farre as the Canon will doe, it is a manifeſt error, and a ridiculous thing to ſay, that this error may bee redreſſed by charging the Culuering with a more quantitie of powder,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and that thereby the Culuering ſhall ſhoote as muche grounde or more than the Canon will doe. For that exceſſe of powder beeing put into a Canon charged before with his due charge of the ſame powder, will cauſe that Canon to ſhoote perchaunce more grounde than the ſaide Culuering can doe. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the more charges or expences which your Lordſhip ſaith is but a trifle, I ſay that the ſame is much more than your Lordſhip doth ſuppoſe it to be: for if I be not deceiued, the Culuerings beeing made more longer than the Canons, muſt alſo by reaſon bee made more thicker of mettall. This being ſo, there is more mettall put in a Culuering than in a Canon, and conſequently a Culuering is much more heauier than a Canon, and being more heauier muſt alſo be drawne with a more number of Oxen or Horſes than a Canon muſt haue, and there muſt bee alſo a more number of men to gouerne thoſe Oxen or Horſes, and a more quantitie of victuale prouided aſwell for the cattaile as for the men which do gouerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beſides the wages which the Prince or Comminaltie that ſendeth foorth thoſe men by the commaundement of the Prince, doe ordinarily pay vnto them. And ſo beholde what may followe in the end through this ſmall error committed by the Prince. But if the error bee ſo much in one Culuering, whoſe pellet waigheth twentie pounde, you ſhall finde it much more greater in that Culuering whoſe pellet waigheth 30, 40, 50, or 60 pounde waight, as I haue learned of a Gunner who hath had experience thereof.</p>

                     <p>The length of the canon or concauitie of each Peece ought to be ſuch, as in the very ſame inſtant when all the powder is a fier, the pellet ſhould be perceaued to be iſſuyng at the very end of the Peece. That is to ſay, at the mouth of the Peece, for in that inſtant all the expulſiue vertue of the powder begins to worke on the pellet in the chiefe of his furie or force, and after that vertue explſiue hath wrought on the pellet, the ſaid pellet finding nothing to let or reſiſt his range (except the aire) will flie more farther than if the concauitie of that Peece had beene more longer, or more ſhorter. For if the concauitie of that Peece had been more ſhorter, the pellet woulde haue bin gone out of the mouth of the Peece before al the powder had bin fired, &amp; before all the expulſiue vertue of the gunpowder had wrought vpon the pellet, &amp; ſo a part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would haue bin to no purpoſe.

And it is true that the ſame windie force doth not worke ſo much in driuing foorth the ſame pellet when it is without the concauitie of the peece, as it doth when it is within the concauitie of the ſame.

                     <p>The proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall woorke is to be vnderſtoode in this ſorte: ſuppoſe for an example, that this our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non whoſe pellet waigheth 20. pound waight is mounted at an eleuation giuen, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ⅔ partes in powder of the pellets waight, and that it doth then ſhoote 1000. paces, and that the ſame Cannon is afterwards diſcharged with ſo much powder as the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let doth weigh, the which quantitie of powder is once and a halfe ſo much as ⅔ partes in<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1872:21"/>powder of the pellets waight, now I ſay if this exceſſe of powder doth woorke proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally on the pellet, then that peece will ſhoote at the ſame eleuation iuſt 1500 paces, that is to ſay, once and a halfe ſo much as it did when it was diſcharged with ⅔ partes in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the pellets waight. And I ſay that this peece in ſuch a caſe will not ſhoote the ſame 500 paces of more ground, nor perchaunce the halfe thereof, that is to ſay 250 paces. But wee will ſuppoſe heere that the peece will ſhoote the ſame 250. paces of more grounde, which in the whole ſumme is 1250 paces. And alſo I ſay whoſoeuer ſhall ſhoote the ſame Cannon with ſo much powder as the pellet weigeth and ⅓ part more which is in the whole 4/3, that this ſecond third will not increaſe the ſame range of the pellet ſo much as the firſt third did. That is to ſay, it will not increaſe by 250 paces as by ſuppoſition it did with the firſt third, but it increaſeth much leſſe than the ſaid 250 paces. And likewiſe whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doth adde ⅓ part of powder more vnto the aforeſaide 4/3 partes of powder,<note place="margin">Note.</note> ſhall thereby increace the far flying of the pellet, but not ſo much as the exceſſe of the ſecond third did. So that eache increace or exceſſe of the powder vnto a certain meaſure or limite, doth alwaies cauſe the peece to ſhoote ſomewhat farther. But after the exceſſe of the firſt third, the ſaid increaſe by the other exceſſes doth decreaſe vnto that meaſure or limmite, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that limmite or meaſure vpwardes whoſoeuer doth adde more powder ſhall not make the peece to carry farther.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And the exceſſe or ouerplus of powder may be ſo much, as that it will not make the peece to caſt more ground but leſſe ground.</p>

                     <speaker>Nicho.</speaker>
                     <p>This is the reaſon thereof. All the powder (how fine ſo euer it be) doth not fier at one inſtant, that is to ſay, the powder which is at the touchhole is a fier before that which is farther of from that place, and the powder which is more nearer to the touchhole is a fier ſomwhat before the powder that is more farther of from the ſame. This propoſition being granted, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the ſame part of powder which is in the concauitie of the peece moſt neareſt to the touchhole,<note place="margin">That part of gunpowder which is in the concauitie of the peece moſt neareſt to the touchole doth fiar before that part of gunpowder which is more remote.</note> doth fier before that which is more remote. And that I may be the better vnderſtood, I will deuide in my mind al the length of the powder which is found to be in<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1872:21"/>the ſame concauity into four equall parts. I ſay then that the ſame part of powder which is next to the touchhole doth fier before the other part which is next adioining vnto it, and in fiering cauſeth ſo great a quantity of windy exhalations, that ten ſuch places as that is where the powder was firſt a fiar, will not bee able to receaue the ſame exhalations and therfore according as the ſame exhalations are continually cauſed by the powder which continually is ſet on fier, ſo it is neceſſary for that exhalation to go forwards in getting by force a more bigger place than the place of the powder which is the cauſe of the ſame, and it cannot get ſuch a place but by two waies, the firſt of theſe two waies is by expelling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it with violence the reſt of the powder which is not a fire, and which is towardes the mouth of the peece together with the pellet, or elſe by making the peece to breake, and bicauſe it is to be thought that the ſame exhalations wil more eaſily thruſt out the powder together with the pellet than make the peece to breake, and eſpecially the pellet being at the extreme or end of the concauity, I ſay then that the firſt fourth part of our ſaid powder which was firſt a fire goeth on continually burning, and expelleth before it the other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der lying next before the ſame &amp; conſequently that expelleth out the pellet, and the pellet being very neare out of the peece, at the firſt and leaſt thruſt which it feeleth in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning goeth out of the ſame ſuddenly, and is expelled onely with the whole and vnburned powder (as hath bin ſaid) &amp; not by the proper exhalation of the fiered powder, the which expultion being made ſo in the beginning, may not be but weake in the pellet, I ſay weake in reſpect of that it will be when the pellet is expelled onely by the windy exhalation and in the chiefe of the great furie of that exhalation, beſides this the vnburned powder fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the pellet going out of the peece, and within a while after falleth downe to the ground, and this powder by going in the ayre, and then falling downe vpon the ground, doth much let the going of the windy exhalation which followeth after the Pellet, &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders much the range of the ſame pellet. So that for theſe reaſons the pellet in ſuch a caſe will not range very far. But ſuch a peece being diſcharged with ſomewhat a leſſe quantity of powder will without doubt ſhoote farther than that peece will doe whoſe concauitie was filled with gunpowder, for in this ſecond manner or way all the concauitie is not full of powder by the length of twice the thickneſſe of the pellet, and the pellet being in the charge will not be found ſo at the extreame of the peece his mouth, but more within. And therefore the pellet will not ſo go out of the mouth of the peece at the firſt and leaſt thruſt of the powder, but will reſiſt a little more than the other: within which time much more of the powder wil be a fiar, and conſequently a greater quantity of windy exhalations wil be cauſed, &amp; the pellet with a more force or fury ſhalbe thruſt out &amp; expelled, I ſay thruſt out &amp; expelled with the powder, &amp; not only by the windy exhalation as it was ſaid of the other ſhoot. And ſo by theſe euident reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in this ſecond ſhoot with leſſe powder, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that the peece wil ſhoot farther tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it did at the firſt when al the concauity was ful of powder. And likewiſe if you wil alſo charge the peece again with a leſſe qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity of powder, I meane with ſo much powder as wil not fil al his concauity by the length of thrice the thicknes of the pellet, I ſay that in ſuch a caſe the ſame peece wil ſhoot farther than it did when it was charged with gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>powder vp to the mouth within twice the thicknes of the pellet. And ſo if you wil charge the peece again with powder vp to the mouth within 4. times the thicknes of the pellet, it will ſhoote farther than it did when it was charged with powder vp to the mouth within thrice the thicknes of the pellet, likewiſe the peece being charged with gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder vp to the mouth within fiue times the thicknes of the pellet wil ſhoot farther tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it did when it was charged with gunpowder vp to the mouth within foure tymes the thickeneſſe of the pellet, and ſo it proceedeth vnto a certaine meaſure being a meane betweene thoſe two extremeties. When you are come to that certaine meaſure,<note place="margin">Note.</note> you ſhall finde this worthineſſe in it, that he which will then charge that peece vvith a leſſe quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of powder than that certaine meaſure is, ſhall ſhoote a leſſe diſtance than hee did vvith that certaine meaſure, and likewiſe he which will charge the peece with more powder than that certaine meaſure is,<note place="margin">We muſt kepe a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene 2. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> ſhal alſo ſhoote a leſſe diſtance than he did with that certaine meaſure.</p>

The ſame thing in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth happen when the gunpowder doth lye much diſperſed and very looſe, and eſpecially when it lyeth in a long fourme like vnto a traine which is made to ſet a thing that is far of on a fire: in which traine that part of gunpowder is firſt a fire which is at that end of the traine where the fire was firſt giuen, and afterwardes the fire goeth burning continually and ſucceſſiuely the reſt of the gunpowder by little and little euen to the other end of that traine, and the more lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that the traine is, the more longer will the time be before all that gunpowder be a fire the very ſame may be applyed to this caſe of artillery, for the powder lying diſperſed and looſe in the concauitie of a peece, doth lye in a long fourme and faſhion, and therefore it will bee the longer before it bee all a fire, and for that cauſe the effect of that gunpowder wil not be of ſo greate a force.<note place="margin">He doth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the force of gunpowder that doth ram it downe to hard, in the peece, or that doth ſuffer it to lye much diſperſed and looſe.</note> And hereupon I conclude that the powder lying too hard rammed downe in the peece, or lying too much diſperſed and looſe, weakeneth the effects of that peece, and therefore it behoueth vs to keepe a meane (as before hath bin ſaide) and not to be in extremities, that is to ſay, the gunpowder muſt not be rammed downe too hard, nor ſuffered to lye to looſe.</p>

                     <p>I know by experience that when a pellet is ſhot out of a peece at a wall which ſtandeth very neare vnto the ſaid peece, that the ſame pellet doth not worke ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, nor pearce ſo farre into that wall, as it would haue done if the wall had bin farther of, but by the reaſons which you alleage in your nwe ſcience, it ſhould be otherwiſe, for you ſay there, that the more farther the pellet flieth from the peece, the more ſloer doth it goe, and that where it goeth ſlolie, there it woorketh a little effect. Then by how much more nearer the peece is to the place at which you ſhoote, by ſo much ought his pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to woorke a more effect on the place where it ſtrikes than that pellet will doe which is ſhot out of a peece lying more farther of from the ſaid place, becauſe the pellet that is ſhot out of the peece planted neare vnto the ſame place, ſtrikes it with a more ſwifter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and yet as I haue ſaid, I know by experience that it will come to paſſe otherwiſe, and therefore I aſke of you what is the cauſe of this inconuenience?</p>

                     <p>There is an other doubt in which I would bee reſolued, and it is this: If you plant a Peece of Artillerie too neare vnto the thing at which you ſhoote, by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which you haue alleaged, and by the experience which I haue had therein, the effects of that Peece will not bee ſo forceable as they would in a meane diſtance. Likewiſe if you plant a Peece too far of from the place at which you ſhoote (by the opinion of all men) the ſame will happen, I meane if you plant a Peece too farre of from the marke, it doth not worke ſo effectually in the thing where it hits, as it woulde doe in a meane diſtance. Now I aske of you whether by reaſon a place may bee appointed where the pellet ſhot out of ſuch a Peece of Artillerie finding no let or reſiſtance in any part of his way or range ſhall worke moſt effectually?<note place="margin">Note.</note>

                     <p>If the pellet at that very inſtant when it commeth to ioyne with the furthermoſt part of the ſaid airie figure (whereof I haue ſpoken in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Colloquie) ſhall finde there an obiect, then in the ſame place it will worke more effectually than in any other place: For if the obiect be more towardes the mouth of the Peece, the ſaid ayrie figure will ſtrike that obiect before the pellet will hit the ſame, as it hath been ſaide in the precedent Colloquie, and immediately after the bloe, it reboundes backwardes againſt the reſidue of the ſame ayrie figure and pellet, and hinders ſomwhat the range of the pellet, as hath been ſaid in the precedent Colloquie. And if the obiect ſhould be farther from that place, then ſo ſoone as the pellet is wholy gone from that airy figure: that is to ſay, hath left that ayrie figure behinde it, immediately it findes the ayre as it were quiet, whereby the pellet doth with more difficultie penetrate that quiet ayre, than the aire of the ſaid airie figure which goeth likewiſe towards the ſame place to which the pellet doth goe: and therefore the pellet being gone from that airy figure doth by ſo much decreaſe in force as it doth goe more farther from it, and for that cauſe it foloweth that his effectes will be the more weaker. So that for theſe two reaſons, the pellet ſhoulde worke more effectually on that obiect which is founde to be preciſely in the pellets going out from the end of the ſayde ayrie figure, than in any other place more farther or more nearer to the ſame.</p>

                     <p>Concerning this matter wee muſt thinke that euerie moouing thing may by two waies be let or hindered to mooue a ſide a round and heauie bodie which is ſetled and quiet, the firſt is, to mooue that heauie bodie in the beginning, for after it is mooued, there is no difficultie to maintaine the ſame in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall moouing: the other lett which the ſaide mouing thing may receaue, is that after it hath mooued the rounde and heauie bodie, and that the ſaide bodie is brought to a continuall moouing a ſide, the moouing thing receaues greate hinderaunce if there bee anie lette or reſiſtance againſt it, therefore I ſaie that by the ſame exhalation of wind which the Saltpeter cauſeth, after it is engendered in the peece, there happeneth two great difficulties, the firſt is to mooue ſo ſuddenly the pellet being ſetled and quiet, and therefore in that ſuddaine accident the ſaide windie exhalation finding the peece in that place to be weake in the mettall, or the mettall to be ill vnited or not well cloſed in the caſting, or more weaker in the one ſide than in the other, doth eaſily breake the peece in that place. But if by chaunce the mettall in that place ſhall reſiſt ſo ſtrongly as that the exhalation doth mooue the pellet, then the pellet being mooued from that place, it is not to be feared that the peece will breake there, except ſome ſtraunge accident doth happen to the pellet within the peece as in the end of this Colloquie ſhall be declared. For ſo ſoone as the pellet is in mouing, that exhalation will continue with eaſe if no other let do happen, but ſo ſoone as the pellet commeth to the mouth of the peece, it findes all the aire without the peece, and by how much the pellet together with the ſaid exhalation that thruſteth it to aſſault the aire commeth more ſwiftly, by ſo much the more vnited and with a greater force doth the aire oppoſe it ſelfe very ſtrongly to reſiſt that ſudden moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1872:25"/>and thereuppon in that place an other difficultie or ſtrife riſeth betweene the exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation within (which thruſteth foorth the pellet) and the aire without, that is to ſay,<note place="margin"> 
                           <p>The cauſe of the roaring ſound which a peece of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery doth make when it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p> 
                           <p>A ſound is no other thing than a bloe which 2 bodies that haue no ſoules or liues do make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather.</p>
                        </note> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation woulde goe out of the concauitie, and the aire without doth reſiſt the ſame, but in the end the exhalation within being of a greater force, and getting the victorie, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth foorth and teareth in peeces his ſaide enimie, and through that breaking foorth of the ſame exhalation, the great and roaring ſound which the peece makes doth come.</p>
                     <p>For a ſounde is defined by wiſe men to bee no other thing than a bloe which two bodies that haue no ſoules or liues doe make togeather. Therefore in this caſe it cannot come of any other cauſe than of the bloe which is made by the exhalation engendered within the peece, and the aire without the peece. And then the mouth of the peece being as it were in the middeſt of the ſtrife, doth alwaies ſuffer very much: and this is the cauſe that the peece lacking his due thickneſſe in the ſaid place, or for ſome other vnknowne fault made in the caſting, doth there eaſily breake.</p>

                     <p>I like well of your reaſons, but I haue yet an other doubt which is this, that although a peece doth moſt commonly breake at the breeche where the powder is, or at the mouth, yet ſometimes it breakes in the middle of the concauity, and therefore I doe greatly deſire to knowe the cauſe thereof.</p>

                     <p>The two cauſes of which I haue before ſpoken are generall cauſes, and commonly they cauſe all manner of peeces to ſuffer generally in the ſaid two places more than in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, but beſides the ſayde generall cauſes, we muſt thinke and beleeue that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other cauſes may happen which not onely will cauſe any peece of Artillerie to ſuffer more in the ſaid two places, that is to ſay, at the breeche where the powder is,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and at the mouth, but alſo in the middle parte of his concauitie. <label type="milestone">

                        </label> As for example ſake, if by ill happe the pellet running along in the concauitie findes any little ſtone like vnto a wedge in fourme, or any other harde and little bodie, and that by chaunce the pellet runnes vppon that ſtone or bodie, it muſt needes bee that the ſame ſtone or bodie ſhall let and hinder the moouing of that pellet, and thereby compell the pellet eyther to ſtaie in that place (which commeth to paſſe when the pellet doth goe very ſtraightly or hardly within the peece) or elſe that pellet in paſſing thorow the peece vppon the ſame ſtone or bodie, makes a little leape ouer the ſame ſtone, and that may bee when the concauity of the peece is more wyder than the height or thickeneſſe of the pellet: and ſo if by chaunce the pellet be let by that ſtone or bodie lyke vnto a wedge in fourme, through that let (the ſame being greate or ſtrong) the peece will be forced to breake. And if the pellet ſhall finde that ſtone or bodie in the beginning of his way, the peece will breake in that end or part where the powder is: And if the pellet ſhall finde that ſtone or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in the middeſt of the concauitie, the peece will by reaſon breake in the middle part of that concauitie: And if the pellet ſhall finde that ſtone or bodie neare vnto the mouth of the peece, then it will breake at the mouth: But if by chaunce the pellet ſhall haue roome to paſſe vppon that bodie, then in his paſſage (as before hath bene ſayde) it will of neceſſitie leape vp, and thereby ſtrike the vppermoſte parte of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauitie of the Peece, and rebounde againe to the grounde or vndermoſte parte of the ſame concauitie. The which ſtroke and rebounde cannot bee of ſo little force, but that it is able to cauſe the peece for to breake in that place, and this is one of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall cauſes which is able to breake a peece in any place. Alſo when a pellet is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallie rounde, or is in one parte more higher than in an other, the peece will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times breake about the mouth.<note place="margin">A braſſe peece of artillery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made hot with ſhooting is apt to breke.</note> Alſo a peece made of Braſſe mettall being made verie hotte by often ſhooting in it, is more apt to breake than when it is colde. For the braſſe mettall is of ſuch nature as that being hotte, it will ſoone breake. Alſo by how much the more higher you doe ſhoote with a peece, by ſo much that peece doth ſuffer more than any other peece with which you doe ſhoote leuell. Alſo in caſting of the peece there may be cracks and holes made in the ſame,<note place="margin">You may learne by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the 43.

                     <p>Sometimes alſo the concauitie of the peece is not made preciſely in the middeſt of the mettall, but goeth more to one ſide than to an other, whereby the mettall vppon the one ſide of the peece is more thinner, and vppon the other ſide more thicker than it ſhould be, and therefore vppon that ſide where the mettall is more thinner and weaker than it ſhould be, the peece doth ſometimes breake: And this is as much as I can tell you concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the cauſes which do make a peece to breake.</p>

                     <p>IN ſome places at ſometime it may happen that it ſhall be thought a needefull peece of ſeruice to breake greate peeces of Artillerie, wherefore by occaſion of that which hath beene declared in the precedent Colloquie, I will heere ſaye vnto him that is deſirous to learne, that this action may be performed with ſmooth yron wedges, which I would haue ſo made as euery of them ſhould be a foote in length, and at one end thinne like an edge of a knife, and at the other end an inch thicke. For when one of theſe wedges ſhall bee thruſt into a peece charged with powder and pellet, and the thin end of the wedge put in vnder the pellet, it muſt needes bee a let to the moouing of the pellet, and make the pellet ſticking faſt within the peece by reaſon it cannot by any meanes paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the thicke end of the wedge, to breake the peece although it was charged with no more powder than his ordinary charge.

Likewiſe you maie breake any great peece of Artillerie thus. Make in the ground a ditch ſomewhat longer than the peece which ſhall be broken, and in the bottome of this ditch cut a trenche ſo long as that parte of the peece which ſhalbe made hot: Fill this trench with coales, and laie the peece which ſhall be broken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yron wedges or ſtones of halfe a foote in height in the ditch, ſo as the peece in that part<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1872:26"/>which ſhall be made hot and broken, may lie directly ouer the ſaid trench: then hauing couered the Peece in that part, which ſhal be made hot and broken, all ouer with coles, &amp; made a wall of ſtones, or ſome other thing round about it (I meane the Peece) ſo as men may worke vpon it, put fire to the ſaid coles, and with belloes bloe the fire till you haue made the Peece very hot: this done, lift the Peece vp out of the ditch, and with an yron hamer ſtrike hard vppon the hot part of the Peece tyll you haue broken it there: which you ſhall quickly doe.</p>

Therefore I will anſwere your queſtion as I did anſwer his: that is to ſay, a Peece which is diſcharged oftentimes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt needes waxe hot, and ſo ſoone as it waxeth warme, it is made thereby ſomwhat attractiue euen as a cupping or boxing glaſſe, and by ſo much it is made more attractiue, as it is made more hot. Therefore it is no maruaile that your ſaid Peece drew ſande into his concauitie.</p>

And becauſe in ſhooting at markes eſpied on a height, the pellet doth goe much more by a right line, or by a leſſe croked line than the pellet which is ſhot at a marke lying leuell with the Peece, as hath bin ſayd before in the ſecond Colloquie: therefore by how much the pellet ſhot at a marke on a height doth go more righter than the pellet which is ſhot at a mark lying leuel, by ſo much doth that way of the pellet come more nearer or ſooner to meete and cut your ſaid viſuall line, than the way of the pellet which is ſhot at a marke lying leuell. Then making that interſection more nearer by ſhooting at a marke on a height, the thing at which you ſhoote will be beyond that interſection, and ſo the ſaid thing or marke being at the ſayde firſt diſtance, &amp; beyond that interſection, it is impoſsible by reaſon of your ſaid leuel ſight that the pellet ſhall in that caſe ſtrike in the middeſt of the marke.</p>

                     <p>In this caſe there may be diuers alterations becauſe the leuel ſight before at the mouth of the Peece may be of equall height with the leuell ſight behinde at the breech of the Peece, and the ſaid leuell fight before may bee more higher, and alſo more ſhorter than the leuell ſight behinde:<note place="margin">Note.</note> If then by chaunce the leuell ſight before vppon the mouth of the Peece ſhall bee of equall heigth or longer than the leuell ſight behinde vpon the taile of the Peece according to the reaſons alleaged in the beginning of the ſeuenth Colloquie, by how much more farther the marke is remooued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, by ſo much the pellet wil ſtrike more loer. But if the leuell ſight before ſhall be more ſhorter than the leuell ſight behind and that by chaunce it is ſo much ſhorter than the other, as that your viſuall line doth cut the way of the pellet (as is declared in the ende of the ſeuenth Colloquie) in that caſe the pellet muſt needes at the ſeconde ſhoote ſtrike higher than it did at the firſt ſhoote, and yet that may be vnder the marke: that is to ſay, betweene the ſaid marke &amp; the place where the pellet ſtrooke at the firſt bloe, and it may bee alſo preciſely in the midſt of the marke,<note place="margin">Note.</note> &amp; it may bee alſo aboue the marke: For alwaies when the leuell ſight before is ſo much ſhorter than the leuell ſight behinde, as that your viſuall line doth cut the way of the pellet as before hath been ſayd, and that in ſuch a caſe a <hi>Shioppetiero</hi> or Gunner doth ſhoot at a marke lying leuell with his Peece, &amp; through the fault of the two leuell ſights, and not through any fault in himſelfe doth hit vnder the marke, it is manifeſt that the interſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the viſuall line makes in the way of the pellet, by the reaſons alleaged in the ende of the ſeuenth Colloquie ſhall be beyonde the marke: that is to ſay, the marke ſhall be betweene the ſayd interſection and him that doth ſhoote. And therefore if the place to which the marke ſhal be remooued be within that interſection, of neceſsitie the ſaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond bloe will be vnder the marke, and yet it will be more nearer to the marke than the firſt bloe was: that is to ſay, it will be between the marke &amp; the firſt bloe. But if the marke be remooued to the very place of the interſection, the pellet at the ſecond ſhoote will hit preciſely in the middeſt of the marke, that is to ſay, in the marke which lyeth in a right line with the mouth of the Peece. But if the marke be remooued by chaunce beyond the ſaid interſection, the pellet at the ſecond ſhoote muſt needes ſtrike aboue the marke, and it will ſtrike ſo much more aboue the marke vnto a certaine limite, as the marke is more remooued beyonde the ſaide interſection as in the ende of the precedent Colloquie hath been ſayde. But if the leuell ſight before be ſomewhat ſhorter than the leuell ſight behind, and that the ſhortneſſe thereof bee ſo little, as that it is not able to cauſe your viſuall line to ioyn aloe with the way of the pellet, yet in this caſe at euery remoouing of the mark the pellet wil hit vnder the mark, and this notwithſtanding the pellet at the ſecond ſhoote<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1872:30"/>may hit aboue that place, and vnder that place, and alſo in the very ſame place where the pellet did ſtrike at the firſt ſhoote. For if the marke at the firſt ſhoote be by chaunce ſet in the place where your viſuall line paſſeth moſt neareſt to the way of the pellet (as hath been declared in the eight Colloquie) and is afterwardes tranſported beyond that place, without doubt the pellet will ſtrike at the ſecond ſhoote more vnder than it did at the firſt ſhoote: The ſame followeth when the marke is ſet beyonde that place, but when the marke is ſet at the firſt ſhoote within that place where your viſuall line paſſeth moſt neareſt to the way of the pellet, that is to ſay, more neare vnto you, and is afterwardes remoued for the ſecond ſhoote more nearer to that place, the pellet will ſtrike at the ſecond ſhoote higher than it did at the firſt: and yet that bloe will bee vnder the marke: that is to ſay, the pellet will ſtrike betweene the firſt bloe and the marke. But when the marke is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without that place where your viſuall line paſſeth moſt neareſt to the way of the pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, it may be remoued ſo little without that place, as that the ſecond bloe will be betweene the firſt bloe and the mark, and it may be remoued ſo much without that place, as that the ſecond bloe will be vnder the firſt bloe, and it may be ſo proportionally remoued without the ſaide place, as that the ſecond bloe will hit preciſely in the place of the firſt bloe, and all this will appeare very plainely to him that doth conſider well of the figure in the eight Colloquie. But when the leuell ſight before hath his due and conuenient ſhortneſſe in reſpect of that leuel ſight which is behind, the which thing happeneth very ſeldome times: that is to ſay, that the viſuall line doth preciſely touch and not cut the way of the pellet, then if in ſuch a caſe any <hi>Schioppetiero</hi> or Gunner ſhall ſhoote at any marke vppon a right line, &amp; by meanes of the ſaid two leuell ſights, and not through his owne fault ſhall ſtrike with the pellet vnder the marke, it may be by that which hath been ſpoken and declared in the ninth Colloquie that the ſaid marke is both within and without the touch of thoſe two lines, for the marke being ſo within or without that touche, the pellet alwayes ſtrikes vnder the marke as may bee eaſily perceaued by the figure in the ninth Colloquie. But when the firſt bloe is much vnder the marke, it may bee adiudged that the marke is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſayde touche, for the marke being within the ſayd touche, the pellet can not hitte very loe by the reaſons alleaged in the ſaid ninth Colloquie. And if the marke being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſayde touche, be ſet more without the ſame touche, certainelie the ſecond bloe will bee muche vnder the firſt bloe. But when the marke being ſet within the ſaid touch is remoued to a place more farther, it may happen that the marke in the ſecond place is within that touche, and it may bee in the very touche, and it may bee alſo without that touch. If the marke then in the ſeconde place bee ſet within that touche, the ſecond bloe will bee aboue or higher than the firſt bloe, and yet it will be vnder the marke: that is to ſay, it will bee betweene the marke and the firſt bloe. But if by chaunce the marke in the ſeconde place bee ſet in the verie point of the touche, the ſeconde bloe will bee preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the middeſt of the marke: But if the marke in the ſeconde place bee ſet without the ſayd touche, it may bee ſo much without the ſame, as that the ſeconde bloe will bee loer than the firſt bloe, and it may bee alſo ſo little without that touche, as that the ſeconde bloe will bee higher than the firſt, and yet it will bee vnder the marke: that is to ſay, betweene the marke and the firſt bloe. And it may bee ſo proportionallie without as that the ſeconde bloe will ſtrike preciſely in that place, where the firſt bloe ſtrooke.</p>

                     <p>I perceiue by your arguments before alleaged, that your opinion is if the leuell marke at which I ſhoote be not ſet in the point where my viſuall line meetes with the way of the pellet, that I cannot ſtrike the ſaid marke in the middeſt, the which thing on the one part as I conſider muſt needes bee true by naturall reaſon, ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part my long experience cauſeth mee to thinke otherwiſe of the ſame. But before I doe tell you in what part that agreeth not with my experience, I will deſire you to open this doubt vnto mee: whence commeth it that euery <hi>Schioppetiero</hi> and euery Gunner ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the more nearer he ſtandes vnto a marke lying leuell with his Peece, the more apt hee is with euery ſorte of leuell ſightes to ſtrike in the marke or to make a faire ſhoote.</p>

                     <speaker>Nicholas.</speaker>
                     <p>To open your doubts concerning all ſorts of differences which may happen in the two leuell ſights, I will firſt beginne with this: when by chaunce the leuell ſight before is preciſely of the ſame height that the leuell ſight behinde is of, I meane when the leuell ſight before is equally ſo high as the leuell ſight behinde, then by how much he that ſhootes ſtands more nearer to the marke, by ſo much he ſhall be more apt to ſtrike in the marke or to make a faire ſhoote, and this commeth to paſſe through two cauſes. The firſt of them is for that alwayes as before hath been ſaid in the ſeuenth Colloquie, that Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne or Peece will ſhoote vnder the leuell marke, and the bloe will be by ſo much more vnder the marke, as he which ſhooteth is more farther from the marke: and contrariwiſe by how much he which ſhooteth is more nearer to the marke, by ſo much the bloe ſhall bee the leſſe vnder the marke, and the loeſt ſtroke which may happen in the like caſe ſhall be when he which ſhootes ſtandes ſo neare vnto the marke, as that the ende of the leuell ſight before doth as it were touch the ſaid leuell marke: and the bloe which ſtrikes leaſt vnder the marke is about ſo much vnder, as is that diſtance which is betweene the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames or endes of the leuell ſights and the concauitie of the Peece, which may be a little more than the thickneſſe of the mettall of the Peece at the breech,<note place="margin">Note.</note> which in a Handgunne may be neare ſo much as the thickneſſe of one finger, and in a great Peece, ſo much more as the Peece ſhall bee more thicker of mettall at the breeche: and although the pellet ſo ſoone as it is gone out of the mouth of the Handgunne or Peece doth goe continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining downewardes as hath been ſhewed in the thirde Colloquie, yet in that little time while the pellet may be ſeene, his ſaid declining ſhall not be ſenſible, that is to ſay, it ſhall not with our eyes be diſcerned. Therefore in a ſhort way by reaſon of the ſaide leuell ſightes that Handgunne may hit a little more vnder the leuell marke than the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a finger, which before hath been ſpoken of, I ſay by meanes of the leuell ſightes,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and not through the fault of him which ſhootes, for the faultes and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſes which may chaunce through his faulte that ſhootes, are not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within our Argumentes. And this is the firſt cauſe why a <hi>Schioppetiero</hi>  and alſo a Gunner when hee ſtandes neare vnto the leuell marke, and ſhootes in a Peece that hath his leuell ſight before of equall height with the leuell ſight behind, is more apt to ſtrike in the marke, or to make a fayrer ſhoote than when hee ſhall ſtand more farther of from the ſayde marke: And by the ſame reaſon, the like wyll happen when the leuell ſighte before is ſomewhat longer than the leuell ſight behinde, for in ſuch a caſe as hath been ſayd in the ſeuenth Colloquie, the Peece will alwayes ſtrike vnder the leuell marke, and by ſo much the more vnder, as he which ſhootes ſhall be the more farther of from the marke, and the bloe in ſuch a caſe ſhalbe at the leaſt ſo much loer than the mark, as is the ſpace betweene the top of the leuell ſight before, and the concauitie of that Peece<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1872:31"/>or a little more, the which loneſſe when the marke is as hath been ſaide very neare to the mouth of the Peece, may be little more than the thickneſſe of a finger. But in an equall diſtance the bloe will be a little more loer than is the ſpace betweene the toppe of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſight before, and the concauitie of the Peece, eſpecially in a very ſhort diſtance: So that this is the firſt cauſe as hath been ſayd why a <hi>Schioppetiero</hi> and alſo a Gunner when he ſtandes neare vnto the marke lying leuell with his eye, and ſhootes in a Peece that hath his leuell ſight before ſomewhat more higher than the leuell ſight behinde, is more apt to ſtrike in the marke,<note place="margin">Note.</note> or to make a more fairer ſhoote than when hee ſhall ſtand more farther of. But beſides this firſt cauſe I thinke that euery Gunner and <hi>Schioppetiero</hi> doth perceiue by naturall reaſon an other cauſe, which is this,<note place="margin">When a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

And therefore I ſay when the leuell ſight before is of equall height or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more longer than that behind, then the Gunner and <hi>Schioppetiero</hi> (for the reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleaged) by how much the more nearer he ſtands to the mark, by ſo much he is more apt to ſtrike the marke at which he ſhootes, or to make a more fairer ſhoote.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Much more by the ſaid reaſons the very ſelfeſame thing will come to paſſe when the leuell ſight before is ſomewhat ſhorter than the leuell ſight behinde, and more ſhorter, or not ſo ſhort as it ſhould be: for in any way you wil, as let it be loer, there the viſual line commeth to be more nearer to the way or line in which the pellet goeth, and continually commes more nearer vnto it, vntil it cutteth, toucheth, or paſſeth more nearer to the way of the pellet than it did in the two former poſitions of the leuell ſights. For in the ſame, the ſaid viſuall line doth goe from the way of the Pellet, and in this continually it commes more nearer to the way of the pellet vntill it commes to the aforeſaid place: And although alſo in this ſecond po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the leuell ſights, by how much more the marke which lyeth leuell with the Peece ſhall be within that place where the viſuall line doth meete with the way of the pellet, or within that place where it paſſeth neare to that way or line in which the pellet goeth, by ſo much the ſtroke ſhall be more loer, as it hath been declared in the ſeuenth, eight, and ninth Colloquies, and yet that loneſſe may bee but little as hath been alſo ſayde in the ſame Colloquies. For the moſt loneſſe that may be there, is the ſame which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the other two firſt: that is to ſay, when the marke which lieth leuell with the peece is very neare vnto the leuell ſight before, I meane the leuell ſight vppon the mouth of the Handgunne or Peece, the which in a Handgunne can bee little more than the thickneſſe of one finger as before I haue declared. Then in a Handgunne whoſe mouth is laide very neare to the marke, the greateſt loneſſe is little more than the thickneſſe of a finger, but the marke being ſomewhat farther of from the mouth of the Peece it muſt needes be that the bloe ſhall not be ſo loe vnder the marke as the thickneſſe of a finger, and it ſhall bee by ſo much leſſe vnder the marke, as it ſhalbe more farther from the mouth of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne ſo that it be not beyond the ſaid interſection or touch which the viſuall line makes in the line or way of the pellet, or beyond the moſt nigheſt part thereof.<note place="margin">Note</note> Then the marke being at the leaſt tenne paces from the mouth of the Handgunne, the loneſſe of that ſtroke will bee ſcant ſenſible. Beſides this as hath been before ſayde, when he that ſhootes is very neare vnto the marke at which he ſhootes, I thinke that by a certaine natural diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he doth not take his leuel preciſely in the midſt of the marke, but a little thing aboue: for he ought to know by naturall reaſon as before hath been ſaide, that the toppes of the two leuell ſights are ſomewhat aboue the mouth of the Handgun out of which the pellet flieth, and by ſo doing (as I thinke he doth) he ſhal amend that little error which the pellet would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit in ſtriking vnder that mark: &amp; for theſe two cauſes that <hi>Schioppetiero</hi> or Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with that kinde of leuell ſights generally ſhalbe more apt to ſtrike the marke ſet in a place neare vnto him, or to make at it a fairer ſhoot than he ſhal do with the two firſt kinds of leuell ſights of which I ſpake in the beginning of this Colloquie. For in that kinde of leuell ſights the viſual line by a great ſpace goeth as it were ioyned or little diſtant from 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1872:32"/>the way of the pellet. And therefore in all that ſpace which is betweene the mouth of the handgunne and the place where the viſual line doth meete with the way or line in which the pellet doth goe, or where the ſaid two lines are moſt neareſt, hee is not ſubiect as it were to commit any error for the reaſons before alleaged by meanes of the leuell ſights.</p>

                     <p>You haue fully ſatiſfied me with your reaſons, for of the one part I affirme by thoſe reaſons which you haue alleaged in the precedent Colloquie, that it is impoſſible to ſtrike a marke which lyeth leuell with the mouth of the Peece, when that marke is not preciſely in the pointe of the interſection, or in the touch of thoſe two lines meeting together: that is to ſay, of the viſuall line, and the line or way in which the pellet doth go. And of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part it hath ſeemed to me through my longe experience that it ſhould be otherwiſe: for I haue ſhot in my handgunne and killed therewith many litle birdes, of which ſome haue ſtoode in a competent longe diſtance from me, and ſome of them haue ſtoode but in a meane diſtance from me, and ſome other of them haue ſtoode very neare vnto me. The which thing would not ſo haue chaunced if it had bin ſo as I did at the firſt ſuppoſe it to be. For if the leuell ſights vpon my handgunne be ſuch as will make my viſuall line to meete with the line and way of the pellet, it is to bee beleeued that it doth ſo alwaies as it were in one and the ſelfeſame diſtance, eſpecially when I ſhoote after one ſorte, and charge alwaies in one and the ſelfeſame maner. And therefore the thing being ſo, if I ſhoote more ground or leſſe ground than that appointed and determinate diſtance, it wil be impoſſible to ſtrike the very miſtdeſt of that marke which lieth leuell with the Peece: But this (as before hath bin ſaid) is already founde by experience to be otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that is to ſay, it hath bin my hap oftentimes in a common diſtance,<note place="margin">When you wil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I haue prooued before in the firſt colloquie of this booke, that the pellet of yron at any eleuation, will flie farther than a pellet of lead when both of them are ſhotte with the ſaid equall quantitie of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Therfore if the thing at which you ſhoote be ſo farre of that the pellet of lead cannot fly thether, and that the pellet of yron may flie thether, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to iudge the ſame though I ſay nothing. But if the marke at which you ſhoote, ſhalbe in a conuenient diſtance for the one &amp; the other ſhoote, and that the ſame obiect is not of ſo harde a ſubſtance, as that it will bruſe and beate the pellet of lead flat, without doubt the pellet of lead by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his more waight, wil do a greater exploite, and pearce farther into that obiect than the pellet of yron wil doe.<note place="margin">The waight of a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more than the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof.</note> For the waight of a thing worketh more than the ſwiftneſſe thereof (as before in the 16. Colloquie of the firſt booke hath beene declared) but when the marke at which you ſhoote is of ſo hard a ſubſtance, as that it will bruſe and beate the ſaid pellet of lead flat, in that caſe it is doubtfull whether the pellet of yron will penetrate ſomewhat farther then the pellet of lead. But although it be ſo, that the pellet of lead doth not penetrate ſo farre in as the pellet of yron, yet by reaſon of his more waight the pellet of lead will ſhake the thing which is ſtrooken a great deale more then the pellet of yron wil doe. And all this which hath beene ſpoken of the ſaide pellets ſhot with the ſaid equall quantitie of powder, wil be more verified by ſhooting them with their ordinarie quantitie of powder, that is to ſay with ⅔ partes in powder of that which euery of thoſe pellets doth waie by it ſelfe, I meane in ſuch things which are not apt by their hardneſſe to batter and bruſe, the pellet of lead will doe a more greater effect, and penetrate farther tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the pellet of yron, when euery of them is ſhotte with the aforeſaid equal quantitie of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Likewiſe in thoſe things which by their hardneſſe are apt to bruſe and beate flatte the pellet of lead, although peraduenture the pellet of yron may pearce ſomewhat farther in, yet the pellet of lead wil geue a greater ſtroke and ſhake more the ſame obiect than a pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of yron will doe.</p>

For it is wel knowen that the waight of a thing, and likewiſe that the lightneſſe of the thing, doth make fruſtrate the vertue and ſtrength of a moouing thing. For the pellet which is ſhot may be ſo light, that it wil flie but a very little way from the mouth of the Peece. Alſo it may be ſo heauie, and expelled with ſo ſmall a quantitie of powder, that the ſame inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience wil folow. Therefore it is needefull for you to ſhew the difference of their weights, and the materiall ſubſtance of each pellet, and the quantitie of powder. For if the one pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let be of lead, and the other of yron, or of ſtone, and each of them be ſhot with ⅔ partes in powder of the waight which the pellet of lead wayeth, it is manifeſt by the reaſons allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the firſt and third Colloquie of this booke, that the pellet of yron or ſtone wil out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flie the pellet of lead. But if one of thoſe pellettes be of lead, or of yron, and the other of light wood, or of ſuch corke as is vſed to be put in pantables and ſlippers, it is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that the heauie pellet (I meane the pellet of lead or yron) ſhot with his ordinarie charge in powder, will flie much farther than the light pellet, that is to ſay, than the pellet of light wood, or corke which is ſhot with the ſame and like quantitie of powder. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe he which ſhall ſhoote a pellet of lead of a hundred pound waight in a Cannon of 9. foote and ½ in length, and likewiſe a pellet of wood as bigge or as thick as the pellet of lead, and ſhal ſhoote the one and the other of thoſe pellettes with a pound or two of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it is to be thought that in this caſe the pellet of wood will outflie the pellet of lead: Whereby we are taught to know that it is needefull to limite a proportion betweene the waight of the thing which is ſhot, and the vertue of the moouing thing.</p>

                     <p>The ſame fault and a greater is in the moſt auncienteſt bookes which are written in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin tongue, for in them it is ſaid, that for a ſtone of 20. pound in waight the hole of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta</hi> muſt be 10. fingers, and the fraction remayning is expreſſed by the ſaide 9 points, but I finde that the ſaide hole would be 10. fingers and ſomewhat more than ¾ of a finger, and ſo he goeth forwardes committing errors in all his other determinations folowing.</p>

                     <p>By the diameter and waights of one pellet of yron, the diameters and waight of many other pellets of yron are found out. And how a pellet of lead is in proportion to a pellet of yron of the ſame bigneſſe as 30. is to 19. And how a pellet of lead is in proportion to a like pellet of a marble ſtone as 4. is to 1. And how a pellet of yron is in proportion to a like pellet of marble ſtone as 38. is to 15.</p>

                     <p>Moſt honorable Lorde, I ſee by this line the diameter of a pellette waying 9 Rotuli, and now by the ſame diameter I will ſhewe vnto you the diameters of many other pellettes. And for the ſatisfiing of others, I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reduce this waight of Rotuli to the waight of this place, that is to ſay, to 33 ounces &amp; ½ for one Rotulo. And becauſe ſome diameters are ſo long as that they cannot be drawne at length in this leafe of paper, I will note onely the halfe of ſuch diameters, ſo as you ſhall perceaue the ſame. And if the diameter which you haue ſhewen vnto me be iuſt, then the ſame diameters which I ſhall Geometrically finde out and ſhewe vnto you will be iuſt, but if there be any error in that diameter which you haue ſhewen vnto me, then the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which I ſhall ſhewe vnto you will be alſo erroneous. Likewiſe if your Rotulo bee iuſt 33 ounces and ⅓, and that each pounde (by which I will now appointe the pellettes to be wayed) doth containe onely 12 ounces, and that there is no difference betweene the ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Lezze,</hi> and the ounce of <hi>Venice,</hi> then the ſaide pellettes may bee wayed and tryed with the waight of <hi>Venice,</hi> otherwiſe not.</p>

                     <p>Gunpowder is made of the aforeſaid three materials, becauſe euery of them will helpe and ſupply euery defect which is in any of the other two: for the Brimſtone is more apt to make the fire flame when it is touched therewith, than any of the other two, the which flame of fire is much more apt to inflame the Saltpeter than any other fire. And becauſe the Saltpeter in burning is reſolued into a windie exhalation, the which is ſo mightie that ſodainly it will extinguiſhe the fllame which hath taken holde of the Brimſtone, and alſo the flame which through the Brimſtone hath taken hold of the Saltpeter, and for that the nature of Brimſtone, and alſo the nature of Saltpeter is ſuch that the flame in them being extinguiſhed there will remaine no token of fire. Therefore in mixing together only the<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1872:40"/>Saltpeter and Brimſtone which muſt be very well pounded, and putting fire to the ſame the fire doth kindle, and immediately after it is extinguiſhed by the reaſons aboue allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: that is to ſay, the fire will not continue till all the matter thereof bee conſumed and burned, but it will burne a while, and leaue part of the ſaide mixture vntouched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Therefore to remedie this defect, a Cole finely pounded is added to the Saltpeter and Brimſtone, for the Cole is of that nature that it will kindle ſo ſoone as it is touched with the flame of fyre, and turnes into an vnflaming fyre, the which fyre without flame by how much it is more blowne with any winde, by ſo much the more ſooner it kindles, and keepes a fyre til all his ſubſtance is turned into aſhes, &amp; therfore the mixture of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid three materials being touched with fyre, the Brimſtone doth immediately flame as before is ſaid, the which flame doth not onely ſet the Saltpeter on a flaming fyre, but alſo in that very inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſets the Cole on a fyre without any flame, the which fyre by winde is not extinguiſhed, but augmented, and therefore that winde which the Saltpeter cauſeth can not extinguiſh the ſaide fyre which is without flame in the Cole, but as I haue ſayd aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it: for the Brimſtone being touched with a flaming fyre, or with an vnflaming fyre, cannot chooſe but flame, the which flame as before hath been ſayde, makes alſo the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter to flame. Therefore when the ſaid three materials being very well pounded, &amp; mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together are touched with fyre, they will not leaue burning till they bee wholy conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, except there be a fault in ſome of the ſaid 3. materials by reaſon of moiſtneſſe, or that the mixture of them is not made by a conuenient proportion. And therefore I conclude that the office of Brimſtone in that mixture is onelie to make a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fyre,<note place="margin">The office of Brimſtone mixed with Cole and Saltpeter.</note> and to bring the ſayde fyre vnto the other two materials, &amp; that the office of the Cole is only to maintaine the ſame vnflaming fyre which the brimſtone brought vnto it,<note place="margin">The office of Cole mixed with Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and Saltpeter.</note> and eſpecially againſt that great winde which the Saltpeter cauſeth.<note place="margin">The office of Saltpeter mixed with Cole and Brimſtone.</note> But the office of the Saltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is onely for to cauſe that ſo great exhalation of winde. For in that winde conſiſtes all the vertue, &amp; propertie of the powder: and that only is the ſame thing which driueth ſo forceably each pellet.<note place="margin">All the vertue and power of gunpowder depends onely vpon Saltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Brimſtone &amp; Cole are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter for no other cauſe than to reſolue the Saltpeter into fire and winde.</note> And therefore I conclude, that all the vertue and power of the powder depends only vpon the Saltpeter, and that the two other ſimples or materials, that is to ſay, the Brimſtone &amp; the Cole are put in for no other cauſe, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue the ſaid Saltpeter into fyre and winde: For whoſoeuer maketh gunpowder only of Brimſtone and Cole, and with a great quantitie of the ſame will charge a Peece of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and then put fyre into the ſaid powder, I ſay that thereby the force of ſuch powder will not be able to expell out of the ſaid Peece any little ſplint of wood, or ſtrawe. This co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes ſo to paſſe becauſe all that vertue expulſiue depends only vpon pure Saltpeter, and not of any other thing. Wherefore it is more poſsible to make powder for Artillerie without Cole and Brimſtone than without Saltpeter. For we may beleeue that it is more poſsible to deuiſe other materials which ſhall doe the office of Brimſtone in taking a flaming fyre, &amp; likewiſe which ſhall doe the office of Cole in maintaining the ſaid vnflaming fyre, than to finde an other materiall which is apt to cauſe ſo great &amp; violent winde as that is which the Saltpeter doth cauſe.</p>

                     <p>The common people report by the authoritie of <hi>Cornazano</hi> that gunnes and gunpowder were deuiſed by chaunce by a Duchman who was an Alchimiſt: But I thinke that <hi>Archimedes</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan,</hi> and moſt skilful Philoſopher, and Mathematician, was the firſt inuentor thereof: and he that wrote the Commentary vppon the firſt booke of <hi>Vitruuius</hi> in the eight leafe is of mine opinion therein: for as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>allurus</hi> declareth in the tenth booke of warfare, it is written in diuers bookes that <hi>Archimedes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed a certaine kinde of enguine made of yron, out of which he ſhot againſt an armie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the land with an incredible ſounde or noyſe ſtones of great waight and bigneſſe, the which thing giueth vs to vnderſtand, that it was an enguine like vnto a great gunne, for that it ſhot very great pellets of ſtones (as not long agoe but within this our age hath byn vſually done) and eſpecially with ſuch an incredible ſounde as in ſhooting of gunnes doth happen: the which ſound (as I thinke) cannot be made in any other ſort of enguine,<note place="margin">The firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of a thing which is homely and ruſtike will with time waxe better becauſe it is an eaſie thing to adde vnto the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed.</note> except in one like vnto a gunne, yet I beleeue in that time gunnes were made of a more deformed faſhion than now they be, for alwayes the firſt inuention is homely, and ruſticke and with time it waxeth better, becauſe it is an eaſie thing to adde vnto the thing deuiſed. And this may be applied to gunpowder, that is to ſay, when it was deuiſed by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> or by any other whom you will, it is to bee thought that it was not made at that time in ſuch order and proportion as it is now at this preſent: For I iudge that from the ſame time hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the order to make gunpowder hath been very many times altered: and for prooffe thereof I haue read in ſome Authours which are not very auncient certaine wayes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to make gunpowder which differ much from the orders and wayes that haue ſince that time been vſed.</p>

                     <p>I haue read in ſome of the moſt auncienteſt bookes that for to make gunpowder a like quantitie of euery of the ſayd three materials muſt bee taken: that is to ſay, ſo much of the one as of the other. And ſome other bookes written ſince that time, willeth them which will make gunpowder, to take three parts of Saltpeter, two parts of Brimſtone, and two parts of Cole. Other bookes teacheth vs to take for the making of gunpowder ten poundes of Saltpeter, three poundes of Brimſtone, and three poundes of Cole. And in ſome other books we are willed to take for the making of gunpowder twelue poundes of Saltpeter, three poundes of Brimſtone, and two poundes of Cole. In other bookes we are willed to take nine partes of Saltpeter, two partes of Brimſtone, and three partes of Cole. And in other bookes written ſince that time we are willed for the making of gunpowder for Handgunnes to take foure partes of Saltpeter, one part of Brimſtone, and one part of Cole. Some other bookes teacheth vs for the making of groſſe or courſe gunpowder, to take twentie partes of Saltpeter, three partes of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and tenne partes of Cole. But for to make ſomewhat more finer powder for the Handgunne, wee are taught to take an hundred partes of Saltpeter, tenne partes of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and thirtie ſixe partes of Cole. Some ſay that for to make groſſe gunpowder wee muſt take an hundred partes of Saltpeter, twentie partes of Brimſtone, and thirtie ſeuen partes of Cole. And for to make fine gunpowder wee muſt take nine partes of Saltpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, three partes of Brimſtone, and ſixe partes of the flower of <hi>Mirochea</hi> when wee will prooue to make gunpowder without Cole. But I knowe not this hearbe called <hi>Mirochea,</hi> for I did neuer reade of any hearbe ſo called in the <hi>Pandecte,</hi> or in <hi>Auicenna,</hi> or in any other Herball. Some other of a later time haue ſayde, that for to make groſſe gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wee muſt take two partes of Saltpeter, one part of Brimſtone, and one parte of Cole made of Willoe: and for to make gunpowder for an Harchibuſe that we muſt take three partes of Saltpeter, one part of Cole made of young bowes of Willoe, and one part of Brimſtone: and for to make fine gunpowder for a Handgunne, they ſay we muſt take of Saltpeter many times refined 5 parts, of Brimſtone 1 part, of Cole made of the twigs of a Filbert tree, or of a young Nutte tree of one yeeres grothe one parte. Some others ſay that for to make groſſe gunpowder we muſt take three parts of Saltpeter refined, one part of Brimſtone and two partes of Cole made of willoe: and for to make gunpowder of a<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1872:41"/>middle ſort, they ſay that we muſt take tenne partes of Saltpeter refined, two partes of Brimſtone, and three partes of Cole made of willoe: And for to make fine gunpowder for an harchibuſe,<note place="margin">Note.</note> they ſay that wee muſt take tenne partes of Saltpeter refined, one parte of Brimſtone and one part of Cole made of the cleane twigges of a filbert tree. And for to make better gunpowder, that is to ſay, for Handgunnes they will vs to take 27 partes of Saltpeter refined, of Brimſtone three partes, of Cole made of the cleane twigges of a Filbert tree
4 partes. Some other ſay that for to make more forceable and ſtronger gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, wee muſt take of Saltpeter refined ſeuen poundes, of Brimſtone one pound, of Cole made of the cleane twigges of a Filbert tree one pounde. Others for to make more better gunpowder will vs to take of Saltpeter refined eight partes, of Brimſtone one part, of Cole made of the young and cleane twigges of a Filbert tree one parte. Some for to make gunpowder more ſtronger haue willed vs to adde vnto the ſaid materials quicke ſiluer: ſome will vs to adde thereunto <hi>aqua vitae.</hi> Some woulde haue vs to adde thereunto ſalt Armoniacke. Some bid vs to put thereunto Campher: ſome will vs to make it with Coles made of the ſtalkes of Coleworts. Others would haue vs to make gunpowder with the Cole of Bulruſhes, or with linnen cloth burned. Some haue prooued to make gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder of diuers colours without Cole:<note place="margin">You may learne to make gunpowder of diuers colours by the 16 chap. of mine Appendix.</note> that is to ſay, white, redde, and gray, by putting into that mixture the powder of ſome flowers of dried hearbes for to ſerue in the place of Cole, and to make the ſayd colours. If I ſhould deſcribe theſe thinges one by one I might haue enough to ſay till to morrow in the morning: But to the intent you may ſee the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene thoſe wayes for the making of gunpowder, I will deſcribe them diſtinctly heereunder one by one as I haue aboue recited them, &amp; alſo diuers other which for breuitie ſake haue not been recited.</p>

                     <p>Without doubt that powder is thought to be of moſt force and ſtrength which conteineth the greateſt part of Saltpeter: I ſay the greateſt part in reſpect of all the three materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. As for example, in the firſt order before noted where is taken of euery materiall one part, the Saltpeter containes ⅓ part of the whole mixture, and the Brimſtone and Coles containes ⅔ partes of that mixture. And in the ſecond order following next after the ſame where is taken 3 partes of Saltpeter, 2 partes of Brimſtone, and 2 partes of Cole, the Saltpeter containes 3/7 parts of the whole mixture, &amp; the Brimſtone and Cole containe ⅘ partes of the ſame mixture: and becauſe 3/7 are a more greater part than is ⅓, therefore I ſay that the gunpowder made after the ſecond order is more forceable and ſtronger than the gunpowder made after the firſt order. Likewiſe the gunpowder made after the thirde order will be more forceable and ſtronger than the gunpowder made after the ſecond or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for in the ſaid third order the Saltpeter containes 7/8 parts of the whole mixture, which 5/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> are a greater part than 3/7: and in the fourth order the Saltpeter containes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>2/17 partes of the whole mixture, and becauſe 12/27 are a greater parte than 5/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> therefore I ſay that <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1872:43"/>gunpowder made after the fourth order is more forceable than that which is made after the third order. And in the fift order the Saltpeter containes 9/14 partes of the whole mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and becauſe 9/14 are a leſſer part than 12/17 I ſay that gunpowder made after the fift order is weaker and worſe than the gunpowder made after the fourth order. And in the ſixt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Saltpeter containes ⅔ partes of the whole mixture, and becauſe 2/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> are a greater part than 9/14 I ſay that gunpowder made after the ſixt order is better and more forceable than gunpowder made after the fift order. And after this faſhion proceeding to examine all the other orders folowing (ſo that I be not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to work &amp; know the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> numbers) I will eaſily know which of thoſe aforeſaid orders is beſt or worſt: that is to ſay, which ſort of gunpowder is moſt forceable &amp; moſt ſtrongeſt, &amp; contrariwiſe, which of thoſe ſortes of gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>powder is of leaſt force &amp; weakeſt. So by knowing how much Saltpeter is in one of thoſe ſorts, you may make a compariſon in goodnes or badnes between one quantitie of groſſe gunpowder for great ordinance, and an other quantitie of ſuch like gunpowder: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe betweene one quantitie of fine gunpowder for handgunnes, and an other quantitie of ſuch like gunpowder: for it would be too long for me to ſet downe an example for euery of the aforeſaid orders.</p>

And this ſort of gunpowder will be moſt ſtrongeſt for two cauſes: The firſt is, becauſe the Saltpeter containes ⅚ partes of that powder, which ⅚ are a greater part than is any of the partes in the other ſortes of gunpowder before noted:<note place="margin">By how much cole of which Gunpowder is made, is of a more lighter, and ſofter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by ſo much it is more apt to receaue and maintaine fire with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie.</note> The ſecond cauſe is, for that the Saltpeter is oftentimes refined, which cauſeth it to bee more perfect: And alſo this ſort of gunpowder is made of the moſt perfecteſt Coles, for in effect by how much the Cole is of a more lighter and ſofter ſubſtance, by ſo much it is more apt to receiue and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fire with facilitie: and therefore it is by ſo much the more perfect, more apte, and more readie to do his office quickly.</p>

                     <p>Yeſterday in the euening you concluded that the 16 ſort of powder is more finer, more ſtronger, and of more force than any of the other aforeſaid ſortes of gunpowder, becauſe that 16 ſort of gunpowder hath in it a greater quantitie of Saltpeter than any of the other ſortes hath, the which quantitie is as much as ⅚ partes of the whole mixture. Nowe I aske of you whether that gunpowder would haue been of more force and ſtrength if it had been made with a greater quantitie of Saltpeter than ⅚ partes of the whole mixture, and with a leſſer quantitie of Brimſtone and Cole than ⅙, I meane of ſuch Coles as were put into the ſayd ſixteenth ſort of Gunpowder?</p>

                     <p>Without doubt it woulde be of more force and power, ſo that the ſayd ſmall quantitie of Brimſtone &amp; Cole bee apte and able to execute their office as they ought to doe, that is to ſay to be on a fire quickly and to ſet the Saltpeter on a fire, and to maintaine fire in the ſame vntill it be wholy reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into fire. For if there ſhoulde be ſo ſmall a quantitie of Brimſtone and Cole, as that thereby they ſhould not be apt and able to execute their ſaide office, that compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on woulde bee vnprofitable and almoſt to no purpoſe: And therefore it is needefull<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1872:43"/>for you to be thereof well aduiſed. For if it were poſſible to make gunpowder onely of pure and perfect Saltpeter, without doubt that powder would bee more ſtronger and of more power than any other ſort of gunpowder made with the ſame Saltpeter, Brimſtone, and Cole. But becauſe the ſaid Saltpeter of it ſelfe is not apt nor able to burne in a flame quicklie as Brimſtone wil do, nor maintaine the flaming fire till al the materials are burnt and conſumed as the Cole will doe, therefore it is neceſſary to adde Brimſtone and Cole thereunto, and ſuch a quantitie thereof as will make them apt and able to execute their ſaid office according as before it is ſaide they ſhould doe.</p>

                     <p>Yeſterday in the euening you affirmed that the ſame gunpowder which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the greateſt quantitie of Saltpeter, and the leaſt quantitie of Brimſtone &amp; Cole (ſo that the Brimſtone and Cole be ſufficient to execute their office is better and of more power than any other kinde of gunpowder made in the ſame ſort of Saltpeter, Brimſtone, and Cole with a leſſer quantitie of Saltpeter, and a greater quantitie of brimſtone &amp; Cole: and although I beleeue this to be true, yet I perceiue that this rule is not generall, for all kind of Artillery, becauſe all men know that handgunnes muſt be charged with finer pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than harchibuſes, and that harchibuſes muſt be charged with finer powder than Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, &amp; Falconets, &amp; that Faulconets muſt be charged with better powder than is put into other great Ordinance: wherefore I aske of you if it be needful to ſhew how fine the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ought to be made for euery kinde of Peece.</p>

                     <p>I doe well vnderſtand you, but what profite comes by that kind of roling or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>

                     <p>You know when you carrie a handgunne or a harchibuſe to ſerue you in your buſineſſe, that it is neceſſarie alſo to carrie with you powder for to charge your peece therewith ſo often as you will, and that ſuch powder is caried in a flaske, and for to charge with meaſure, that there is made vppon the flaske (as you know) a little pipe able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſo much powder as is conuenient for the charge of that handgunne or harchibuſe, and how there is an enguine or ſpring in that little pipe to be ſhut within it when the ſaid pipe is full of powder to keepe the powder within the ſame little pipe that it ſhall not fall out of the ſame into the flaske.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ierome.</speaker>
                     <p>I knew all this before you tolde me of the ſame.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nicholas.</speaker>
                     <p>Although you know all the ſame better than I doe, yet I will tell you thereof that you may the better vnderſtande the matter folowing. And therefore I conclude that if the gunpowder which is put into the ſaid flaske be not corned, it wil be a harde thing to fil the ſaide little pipe with the ſame. For by turning vp the flaske to fill the ſaide pipe with ſuch gunpowder as was in the ſame flask, the ſaid gunpowder wil fall al together in a lump vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the firſt entring place of that pipe, and choke or locke within the ſame all the ayre which was in that emptie pipe, and thereby that ayre will not ſuffer the powder to enter therein, ſo as oftentimes the ſaide pipe will be found to be emptie or not full of powder. But this thing wil not ſo happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if the powder be corned, for ſuch corned powder wil role more a parte or ſeperately (as it hath beene ſaide of corne and meale) the which ſeperation will make a way for the ayre in the ſaide pipe to goe out of the ſame into the flaske, and to fill the place which conteyned the powder that is gone into the ſaide pipe, and by this meanes moſt commonly the ſame pipe will be ſo full of powder as is conuenient for it to be. And for this cauſe men haue beene compelled to deuiſe a meanes to corne gunpowder for handgunnes and harchibuſes, and not for great ordinance. For (as you know) the powder is put into great ordinance and into the loweſt end of the concauitie thereof with a ladle, and therefore it is no matter whether the powder will role or not role, and it will be ſuperfluous to corne powder for great ordinance, for as you know you vſe to carry a little flaske full of the fineſt powder to put into the touchholes of handgunnes and harchibuſes,<note place="margin">Touchpowder ought to be cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>It is euen ſo as you ſay, and your reaſons herein are very true. But I neuer thought that gunpowder had beene corned for ſuch a cauſe, and for that I doe eſteeme of this which you haue tolde me more than of 10 crownes, I doe hartely thanke you for the ſame.</p>

                  <head>The firſt Chapter. The properties, office, and duetie of a Gunner.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Gunner ought to be a ſober, wakefull, luſtie, hardie, patient, prudent, and quick ſprited man, he ought alſo to haue a good eyſight, a good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perfect knowledge to ſelect a conuenient place in the day of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to plant his Ordinance where he may doe moſt hurt vnto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and be leaſt anoyed by them, and where his Ordinance may not be ſurpriſed by the enemie.</p>
                  <p>A Gunner ought to be skilfull in Arithmeticke, and Geometrie, to the ende he may be able by his knowledge in thoſe artes to meaſure heights, depthes, breadthes, and lengthes, and to drawe the plat of any peece of ground, and to make mines, countermines, artificiall firewoorkes, rampiars, gabbions or baskets of earth, and ſuch like things which are vſed in time of warre to be made for offenſiue and defenſiue ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>A Gunner ought alſo to procure with all his power the frendſhip and loue of euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to be carefull for his owne ſafetie, and for the preſeruation of all thoſe that ſhal be about him.</p>
                  <p>Alſo he ought to be no ſurfeter nor a great or ſluggiſh ſleeper, but he muſt gouerne him ſelfe in al times as a wiſe, modeſt, ſober, honeſt, and skilfull man ought to doe, that through want of vnderſtanding he may neuer leeſe his credite, nor an vniuerſall victorie which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes by the meanes of good Gunners well managing their peeces is gotten.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner ought at the receite of his charge to make an Inuitorie of al ſuch things as ſhall be committed to his charge as well to render an account, as to conſider the want of ſuch neceſſaries as to the Artillerie apperteineth.</p>
                  <p>And when a Gunner ſhall be appoynted to doe an exployte, he ought to want neither a fire ſtone, nor a tyndar box with a good ſteele, nor flintſtones, nor tindar, nor gunmatches, nor a flaske full of good touchpowder to kindle his gunmatch and fire, when neede ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>Alſo when a Gunner ſhall be appoynted to doe an exployte, he muſt lay his powder twenty paces from his Peeces in ſuch a place where no fire, water, or hurt may come vnto it through any perſon, or by reaſon of any winde, weather, or otherwiſe, and keeping his powder alwayes couered, he muſt not be vnmindfull of this, that it is a very dangerous thing for a Gunner to truſt many, becauſe a generall hurt and death may thereuppon followe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner that hath a charge ought to haue alwayes in a readineſſe all neceſſarie things for his artillerie: that is to ſay, wheeles, axeltrees, ladles, rammers, ſpunges, gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, pellettes, tampions, chaineſhot, croſſebarres, ſuſtian, canuas, or paper for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredges and firewoorkes, fourmes for ladles and cartredges, needles, threed to ſowe and binde the cartredges and firewoorkes, artificiall torches, candles, lantornes, mattockes, ſhouels, crowes of yron, handaxes, leuers, enguines for the mounting and imbaſing of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, ropes, little handbaskets, glwe or payſt, horſecollers, horſes or oxen to drawe his peeces, all manner of cartware, carters to guyde and keepe his horſes and oxen, and a ſufficient number of Gunners and aſsiſtants to charge, diſcharge, mount, imbaſe, wadde ramme, make cleane, ſcoure, and coole his peeces when they are ouer heated, and to haue for this purpoſe vineger and faire colde water.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner ought alwayes to haue a gunners ſtaffe, or a partiſant, or a halbert ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by him for a part of his defence, and he ought to put into the cocke of his Gunners ſtaffe a gunmatch, or wrappe about the lower end of his ſtaffe, partiſant and halbert a good gunmatch, which may geue fire vnto his peeces of artillerie when neede ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner ought not to ſleepe much at any time of the day, or night, when he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to ſerue in the fielde, or in any other place, nor to eate or drinke in any other roome than where his peeces of artillerie are planted, becauſe in his abſence the ſame pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be choked, poyſoned, and harmed by diuers wayes; and that he may many times vppon a ſudden haue good occaſion to diſcharge all his peeces,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1872:48"/>And it is requiſite for a Gunner to fixe vppon the tayle of the carriage of his peece a cheſt to holde his neceſſary things, and to defende him from ſmall ſhot when he ſhal ſerue in a place where no baskets of earth are ſet to defend him.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner ought to haue a ruler and a payre of compaſſes to meaſure the heigth &amp; length of euery peece his concauitie, and the length, depth, and wideneſſe of euery ladle, whereby he may know whether his peece is laden with too much powder, or is charged with a leſſe quantitie of powder than it ought to haue.</p>
                  <p>A Gunner ought to knowe the names, length, and waight of all manner of peeces, and be able to tell readilie how much gunpowder is a due charge for euery peece, how manie times in one day euery peece may without harme be ſhot of, how many Gunners and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants or labourers ought to attend vppon euery peece, how many horſes, or oxen will drawe euery peece, what ſorte of peeces doe commonly carry pellettes of lead, what ſorte of peeces doe ſhoote Pellettes of yron, what ſorte of peeces are vſually laden with pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes of ſtone, and what ſorte of peeces haue chambers, and how euery kinde of peece ſhould be charged with his powder, tampion, pellet, and wadde.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner muſt be skilfull to make Saltpeeter, to refine and ſublime Saltpeeter, to make diuers ſortes of gunpowder, to make coles for gunpowder, to purifie brimſtone for Saltpeeter, to make cartredges, to amend and make good agayne euery ſorte of gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which by any manner of meanes hath loſt his vertue and force, and tell how much Saltpeter ought to be put into the ſayd vnforceable gunpowder to make it ſo ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as it was before, and how many times the ſaltpeeter which ſhall be put into the ſayde gunpowder ought to be refined.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner in time of ſeruice ought to forbyd with meeke and courteous ſpeeches all manner of perſons other than his appoynted aſsiſtantes, to come neere his peeces, to the ende that none of his peeces may be choked, poyſoned, or hurt, and he ought not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers or rewarde to lende any peece of his gunmatch to another perſon, becauſe it may be very hurtfull to him in time of ſeruice to lacke the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner before he goeth to doe any exployte ought to conſider of all thinges which ſhal be needeful for him to haue, &amp; how farre the place is to which he muſt goe, &amp; by what wayes he ſhall paſſe with his artillerie, that he may carry with him all thinges needefull for his artillerie and for him ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner ought not at any time to beate open the heads of his gunpowder bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels with any yron, or ſtone, but with a woodden mallet which will neuer fire the gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder as a peece of yron and a ſtone may doe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo if a Gunner will charge his peece with Cartredges, he ought to ſet them vpright in a tubbe or ſome other woodden veſſel, which (though it ſhall ſeeme to ſtande in a place out of danger for fire) ſhould neuer be vncouered for any longer time than while the ſame cartredges are taken out one by one to charge the peece.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner ought to waſh his peece within before he doth firſt charge it, and (after he hath dryed it well againe by the helpe of
2 or 3 cleane and dry ſpunges, &amp; made it very clean within) he ought to looke by ſuch meanes as are declared in the 43. Chapter of this <hi>Appendix</hi> whether or no any hony combes, flawes, or crackes are in the ſayd peece.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner before he doth ſhoote ought to conſider and try whether the trunnions in his peece are ſet in their due places, and finding them by the doctrine taught in the 41. Chapter of this <hi>Appendix</hi> to be wrong ſet, preuent the harme which may come thereby.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a Gunner before he doth ſhoote ought to conſider whether his peece is charged with ſtrong and dry gunpowder, or with weake and moyſt gunpowder, to the end he may alwayes lade his peece according to the qualitie of the gunpowder: For as ſtrong and drie gunpowder may driue the ſhot farther than the marke, ſo weake and moyſt gunpowder may cauſe the peece to ſhoote ſhort of the marke.</p>
                  <p>Alſo euery Gunner before he doth ſhoote muſt conſider that his peece ought to haue a due charge in gunpowder: For as when a gunner doth geue vnto a peece more than his duety, he ouerſhootes the marke, and puts the peece after it is made hot in danger of breaking, ſo when he geues vnto a peece leſſe than his duetie he ſhootes ſhorte of the marke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1872:48"/>Alſo euery Gunner muſt charge his peece with a fit pellet: For as the pellet which is more bigger or more higher than it ſhould be putteth the peece in danger of breaking, ſo the pellet which is loar or ſmauler than it ſhould be, wil fall ſhort of the marke, and neuer working his expected effect, ſwarue ſometimes in the deliuerance out of the peece and ſtrike wide of the marke.</p>
                  <p>Alſo euery Gunner before he ſhootes ought to remember that a long wadde of haye, ſtrawe, toe, or of vntwiſted ropes lying behinde a pellet within any peece will cauſe the pellet to ſtrike wide of the marke.</p>
                  <p>Alſo euery Gunner ought to know that a peece of artillery which doth not lye faſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his carriage wil ſhoote awry from the marke.</p>
                  <p>Alſo euery Gunner ought to know that if the carriage of his peece doth not lie right, the peece will ſhoote awry from the marke.</p>
                  <p>Alſo euery Gunner ought to know that if one wheele in the carriage of a peece be more greaſed than the other wheele in the ſame carriage, the wheele which is more greaſed will turne faſter about than the other wheele, and cauſe the Peece lying vppon the ſayd carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to ſhoote awry from the marke.</p>
                  <p>Alſo euery Gunner before he ſhootes ought to remember that if one wheele ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyle faſter than the other wheele, or if anie thing ſhall let one wheele more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Peece will ſhoote awrie from the marke.</p>

                  <p>Alſo euery Gunner ought to weather the marke according to the hardnes of the winde, and the diſtance vnto the marke: For as the winde being with him will cauſe a pellet to flie beyonde the marke according to the hardneſſe thereof, and the winde being againſt him will cauſe a pellet to fal ſhort of the marke according to the hardneſſe thereof, ſo a ſide winde driueth a pellet wide from the marke.</p>
                  <p>Alſo euerie Gunner before he ſhootes ought to driue the wadde and ſhot home vnto the gunpowder, for when the wadde and ſhot do lie ſhort from the gunpowder, the Peece breaketh manie times in the vacant or emptie place betweene the powder and the ſhot.</p>

                  <head>The 2. Chapter. How artificiall Saltpeeter which is a mixture of many ſubſtances hath (as ſome ſuppoſe) greater ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and more ſtrength than mynerall ſaltpeeter: how artificiall ſaltpeeter is made of fine and ſmall earth by two ſundry wayes: how the earth which maketh artificiall ſaltpeeter is digged out of ſellers, vaultes, ſtables, oxſtalles, gote or ſheepecotes, pigen houſes, or out of the loermoſt roomes in other houſes: how blacke earth which will ſparkle in a fire, or yeelde a ſharpe, byting, and meane ſalt taſte doth make good ſaltpeeter: how for the making of artificiall ſaltpeeter you muſt prouide a ſufficient number of cauldrons, furnaces, barrelles, halfe tubbes, and a conuenient quantitie of wood, white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, aſhes of oke, earth, and water, and how the ſayd cauldrons, furnaces, barrels, and halfe tubbes muſt be placed.</head>
                  <p>ARtificiall ſaltpeeter is a mixture of many ſubſtances gotten with fire and water out of drie and durtie grounde, or of the flower that groweth out of walles in ſellers, or out of that ground which is found looſe within vaultes, tombes, or deſolate caues, where rayne cannot come in. And (as ſome thinke) artificiall ſaltpeeter hath greater vertue and more ſtrength than mynerall ſaltpeeter. But the beſt artificiall ſaltpeeter is made of beaſtes dung conuerted into earth in ſtables, or in dunghilles of a long time not vſed, &amp; aboue all other of the ſame dung which comes of gotes and hogges: And it is requiſite what dung ſo euer it be, that by continuance of time it be well reſolued into earth, and all the humiditie thereof being dryed, that the ſame earth ſhould be as it were a ſubtile and fine powder. When you ſhall haue occaſion to make of this dung or earth a great quantitie of artificiall ſaltpeeter,<note place="margin">The firſt way to make artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Saltpeter of earth.</note> it will be neceſſarie for you to prouide many cauldrons, furnaces, barrelles or tubbes, and likewiſe wood, white lime, aſhes of olde oke, and a ſufficient quantitie of the ſayde earth, and a great barne or other walled houſe neere to the water, that you may haue enough thereof, and of euery other material thing. But firſt the furnaces muſt be made for the cauldrons, &amp; they muſt be placed thereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they are which Diers vſe: Then there muſt be prepared ioyſtes ſo long as the houſe, 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1872:50"/>and ſo broade that vppon them commodiouſly aboue ground may ſtand buttes with their heads knocked out, ſquare cheſtes, barrels or tubbes to the number of 50. 60. or 100. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cauldrons, and the capacitie of the place, and betweene euery two of thoſe veſſels, there muſt be ſet a halfe tubbe to receaue the water that ſhall runne out: Or there would be placed a gutter or canel of wood along vnder the holes of the veſſels which are ſet aboue the ground, ſo that it may conuey all the water which commeth from them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one or two great tubbes ſufficient to holde all the water that ſhall be full of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Saltpeeter. And in the buttes which haue their heads knocked out, barrels or tubbes: I ſay in the bottome of euery of them, a hole muſt be made on the one ſide with an Augar, or els three or foure little holes may be made with a good big perſer, and vppon them you may lay a little thinne linnen cloath, or els the ſweeping ende of a broome, or ſome ſtrawe for to keepe the yerth vp, and to ſtrayne the water that ſhall be put amongſt the ſame yerth which is to be wrought when it is taſted with the mouth, ſo that it be certaine that it contayneth Saltpeeter. Then there muſt be made in the middeſt of the houſe where the ſayd Saltpeeter is to be wrought a great hil, next vnto which muſt be made another hil halfe ſo big which muſt be made with two partes of vnſlaked lime, and three partes of oke aſhes, or other aſhes which in taſte are very ſtrong and ſharpe, and then the one hill muſt be wel mingled with the other, and with the ſame compoſition the tubbes muſt be filled which are ſet aloft vppon the ioyſtes within a ſpan of the mouth, or els (minding not to mingle with the yerth the aſhes and the lime together) you may put firſt a ſpan thickneſſe of yerth in the bottome of the tubbe, and then three fingers thickneſſe of the aforeſayde lime, and aſhes, and afterwardes vppon the ſame another ſpan in thickneſſe of yerth, and on that likewiſe another three or foure fingers thickneſſe of lime and aſhes: and ſo putting into the ſayd tubbes one rew of one thing, and another rew of another thing, you ought to fill all the buttes, and tubbes, or other veſſels that you haue placed (euen as aboue I haue ſayd) within a ſpan of the mouthes of them, and the reſt which is then left empty, you muſt fill with water, the which running through all the yerth by a little and a little, muſt drop into the tubbes that ſtande vnder to receaue it, or into a gutter, or canel, or where you liſt, ſo that it be conueyed into one, two, or three ſundry tubbes, or where you thinke good: and ſo you muſt wel and diligently gather all the water which was powred vppon the yerth after it hath paſſed through the holes in the bottome of the tubbes in ſuch wiſe that it may bring with it all the ſubſtance and vertue of the ſaltpeeter which was in the ſayd earth, whereof by putting ſome of it on your tongue you may taſte, and finding it biting and very ſalte,<note place="margin">To know good Saltpeter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> it is a token that it is good, and that you haue done wel: if not, powre it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vppon the very ſame earth, or vppon ſome other nwe earth. But finding the firſt earth full of ſubſtance ſo much as ſufficeth, you may againe powre vppon it more water to waſh better the remnant of the earth: albeit this ſecond water would be ſaued in another veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and after this the earth may likewiſe be waſhed the thirde time, to the intent that all the ſubſtance thereof may be perfectly gotten. But this ſeconde, nor the thirde, ought not to be mingled with the firſt, if it happen not to come of the very ſame taſte, the which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that it wil not: but it muſt be put by it ſelfe in other veſſels for that it is good to powre vppon the change of the next earth, and ſo you may proceede gathering a good quantitie of ſuch water, taking heede neuertheleſſe that it be full of the ſubſtance of ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeter: the which if it ſeeme vnto you not of the ſame perfection as you would haue it, you may powre it againe vppon the very ſame earth, or vppon other nwe, til ſuch time as it ſhal ſatisfie you, and that you ſhal knowe it to be ful of the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſaltpeeter. Beſides this there muſt be made a furnace with one or two cauldrons of braſſe wauled thereon, which muſt be ſo great as thoſe which the Dyers vſe, &amp; theſe cauldro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s muſt then be filled with the ſayd ſaltpeter water: the which (as alredy I haue tolde) ought to be ſo ful of ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as may be, ſo that it haue about the two third partes, and make it faire and ſoftly to boyle ſo much till it come to one thirde part or there aboutes, and after take it of, and put it to ſettle in a great veſſel couered, which muſt be wel bound about with hoopes of yron, and ſure, and cloſe in the ioyning thereof, to the intent it ſpill not: And thus when the ſame water is ſetled, cleere, and from the earth and groſſe matter which in it remayned diligently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it muſt be taken out, and boyled againe of nwe in the ſame cauldron, or in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1872:50"/>And foraſmuch as at euery time that it boyleth if it be not taken heed of, it turneth into skumme, and ſometimes ſwelleth ſo much that by running ouer, it ſpilleth and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth away therwith much of the good, the which minding to remedy, you muſt take three partes of Oke aſhes, and one of Lime, and moreouer in euery hundred pounde waight of water, there muſt be diſſolued foure poundes of Roch Alume, and when the Cauldron boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth take of the ſaid water with a pot, and power into it once or twiſe, ſpecially when you ſee the Saltpeter water riſe in skumme, and ſo doing within a little while you ſhall ſee it alay, and be both cleere, faire, an of an azure colour: and it muſt be boiled ſo long till all the thinne watrineſſe be vapoured away, and the ſubſtance of the Saltpeter thickened, ſo that it being taken out, and put in cheſtes, or tubbes, and cooled, may congeale: the which is beſt done when the water is brought to a ſmall quantitie, taking it out and putting it into a leſſe Cauldron wherein it will ſooner congeale, the which water being taſted, and ſeen to be readie to congeale, you may take it out, and put it into veſſels of wood, or of earth that are rough within, with certaine ſtickes of wood to congeale, and ſo you ſhal let it coole, and reſt three or foure dayes ſo as it may droppe, and be ſtrained through ſome little hole in the bottome of the veſſell: and all the water which is not then congealed, you muſt take out, and ſaue for to ſeeth againe: and the Saltpeter which is in any quantitie congealed, you ſhall finde to be according to the vertue that was in the water, or in the earth: but the cleereneſſe and faireneſſe thereof will come of the maſter vertue of the water which is put into it in the boyling, which hath ſtrength to purge it, and to make it come as it were refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the firſt ſeething. Now this being taken from the ſides of the veſſel where it congea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and in the water thereof waſhed, you muſt lay it vpon a Table to drie throughly, and the ſame ſeeming vnto you to haue neede, or neuertheleſſe minding to haue it aboue the common vſe for ſome purpoſe more refined, and purified from all maner of earthie groſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, fatneſſe, and ſaltneſſe, (which for to make exceeding fine powder or <hi>aquam fortem,</hi> is moſt requiſite ſo to be) I counſell you to refine and purifie after one of the wayes taught in this <hi>Appendix.</hi>

But digge not for any ſuch earth more deeper than the length of 3 ynches vnder the face and vppermoſt part of the floore or ground out of which it ſhalbe taken, except you ſhall ſee in the earth vnder that depth ſuch white things or veines as the Italian mameth <hi>Fiocchi.</hi>

For as when the naile ſo taken out of the hole ſhall haue a pale yelloe culler you ought to thinke that the earth in that place wil yeeld plentie of Saltpeter, ſo when the naile taken out of the hole ſhal haue the naturall culler of yron, you muſt knowe that no Saltpeter will bee made of the earth in that place.</note> Hauing gotten a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantitie of Saltpeter earth made fine and ſmall, and a competent number of halfe buttes, hogſheaddes, or barrels that haue one hole made with an Augar in the bottome of euery of them you muſt firſt couer euery of the ſaid holes on the inſide, with an earthen porenger, and ſtoppe the ſaide holes on the outſide of the veſſels with tappes and ſpiggets.

After this powre a bucket or pale of cleane water by little &amp; litte vppon the ſaide earth: When the earth hath drunke vp this water, powre one other bucket or pale of cleane water in the ſame ſort vpon that earth, and continue in ſo doing till all the earth in the ſaid veſſels is well moiſtened with water, which ought to lie in the ſaide veſſels for the ſpace of a day and a night one handbreadth in heigth aboue the earth: Then pull the ſaid tappes or ſpig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets out of the holes in the veſſels, and ſuffer all the ſaide water to droppe out into other tubbes placed directly vnder the ſaid holes: when you ſhall ſee that no more water will come or droppe into the vndermoſt tubbes, emptie the dropped water into the veſſels out of which it did droppe before, and out of the ſame let it drop againe ſo long, and ſo much<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1872:51"/>as it will into the ſaid vndermoſt tubbes.

But to refine Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter with fire doe thus: Take an yron ſallet, or ſome other yron, or braſen veſſell, and fill it with Saltpeter, and couer it with a couer of yron, braſſe, or earth, ſo that it be made bigge enough, meete to be taken of, and put on when you liſt, and ſo as the veſſell being well co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, the heate within may not breath out. This veſſell muſt be ſet in the midſt of a good fire of coles, and ſo the Saltpeter will melt, which is ſoone perceiued of the expert artificer and workman. When you thinke that it is melted looke vppon it, and if it be not well mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, couer it againe, and let it melt well: Then the Saltpeter being well melted, take Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone moſt finely beaten in powder, and caſt ſome thereon: and if of it ſelfe it take not fire, doe you kindle it, and being kindeled, let it burne till ſuch time as the Brimſtone bee all conſumed, ſo that nothing els be burnt but the vpper part and certaine groſſe vnctiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Saltpeter, the which when it is burned, will leaue the reſt faire and cleare: and then it muſt be taken from the fire letting it coole in the veſſell where you ſhall finde it (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame is colde) all in one peece like a white peece of marble.

But the beſt &amp; moſt readieſt way is to put all the Saltpeeter which you will occupie into a Cauldron that muſt haue ſo much water in it as will (when the ſame is made hot with fire) ſuffice to diſſolue the ſaid ſaltpeter, which being ſo diſſolued ought to be

                  <p>MAny men doe grinde gunpowder in ſuch milles as doe ſerue to grinde crabbes to make vergys, &amp; appels to make ſider.

And ſome cauſe the powder to be ſtamped in morters with a water mill or a horſe mill, which way is the beſt of all other and moſt ſureſt: for the powder is thereby more finely beaten, and with leſſe labour. Some which haue not the commoditie of water make a great wheele after ſuch ſort that the cogges thereof ſhall raiſe vppe many heauie peſtels, which in falling downe doe beate the powder lying within diuers morters of wood made in a beame of Oke: Among which there bee ſome that haue their bottomes of braſſe. Some ſtampe gunpowder with peſtels which they holde in their handes, and tie to the ende of a poole with a corde right ouer a morter of wood, or braſſe, and ſo they beate with leſſe paine. And ſome grinde gunpowder with handmilles as they vſe to grinde corne, which is a painefull and dangerous way,<note place="margin">You ſhall kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle fire by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing two Bay ſtickes togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

                  <p>WHen you haue dried all the gunpowder which ſhall be renued, put ſo much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as you will into a canuaſſe ſachell or linnen bagge, and then tying a corde very hard about the mouth of the bagge, thruſt the ſame into a cleane Cauldron, and powre ſo much water into the Cauldron as will couer the bagge: this done, make the water to boile in the Cauldron till a droppe of it laid vppon yron or ſtone will congeale, and while the water boyleth, remember to ſcumme it as neede ſhall require. After this remoue the Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron from the fire, and ſetting it a ſlope let that bagge drop into the Cauldron, and when you ſhall ſee that the water in the Cauldron is cleare, poure it out by little and litle into an other veſſell, ſo as no lies, or dregges may runne out with the water into the ſame veſſell, becauſe the water muſt there congeale. After the water is congealed take the Saltpeeter out of the veſſell, and as you did before boyle and ſcumme the water which ſhall then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the ſaid veſſell till a droppe of it laid vpon yron or ſtone will congeale. Alſo doe vnto it all that you did before vnto the congealed water, and let it not greeue you to worke thus ſo long as any ſaltpeter may by this meanes bee founde in the vncongealed water.</p>
                  <p>The ſaltpeeter and Brimſton which were within the ſaid bagge did diſſolue and ſoke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the boyling water, yea the diſſolued ſaltpeter turned into water, &amp; the diſſolued brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone ſunke downe to the bottome of the water where you may finde it: But the coles which were mingled with the ſaid diſſolued ſaltpeter and brimſtone remaine ſtill within the bagge among the lies and dregges of the decayed gunpowder: therefore when you haue gathered together by the meanes aboue rehearſed all the ſaltpeter that was in the ſayd boyling water, and haue well dried the ſaid ſaltpeter, brimſtone, and coles, poiſe euery of them by it ſelfe, and then ſeeing how much the part of ſaltpeeter ſo gathered doth want of the quantitie which it ſhould haue for the ſayd parts of cole, and brimſtone, adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the portion of ſaltpeeter which wanteth: That done, beate, mingle, and incorporate them together as you haue bene taught to beat, mingle, and make nwe gunpowder.</p>

                  <head>The 18 Chapter. How you may by taſte, feeling, colour, and burning, know good and il gunpowder: and how among many ſortes of gunpowder, you may know the beſt ſorte of gunpowder.</head>
                  <p>GVnpowder that hath ſo mylde a taſte as that you ſhall ſcant feele it on your tongue, is of good receite and well wrought.</p>
                  <p>By how much gunpowder is in feeling more harder, by ſo much it is more better.</p>
                  <p>Gunpowder of a fayre azure or french ruſſet colour is very good, and it may be iudged to haue all his receites well wrought, and ſufficient of the maſter well refined.</p>
                  <p>Lay 3. or 4. cornes of gunpowder vppon a white peece of paper, the one three fingers diſtant from the other, and put fire to one of them: Now if the gunpowder be good and ſtrong you ſhall ſee them all at one time a fire, and that there will remayne no refuſe or groſeneſſe of brimſton, or of ſaltpeeter, nor any other thing except a white ſmokie colour in the place where they were burned, neither will the paper be burnt or defiled therewith.</p>
                  <p>If good gunpowder be layde vppon the palme of your hande, and ſet on a fire, it will not burne your hande.</p>
                  <p>Gunpowder that hath a very ſharpe taſte, hath abundance of the maſter not wel refined, and will geue againe.</p>
                  <p>If white knottes, or knottes of a french ruſſet colour, ſhall remayne after gunpowder is ſet on a fire, it is a ſigne that the ſaltpeeter in that ſorte of gunpowder was not wel refined, but lefte full of ſalte, and greaſe, eſpecially when the ſame knottes ſhall hiſſe in burning, be dankiſh, and leaue moyſture in the place where the gunpowder was burned.</p>
                  <p>If harde, dry, and white knottes, or pearles, ſhall remayne after gunpowder is ſet on a fire, it is a ſigne that this ſorte of gunpowder was not well wrought:<note place="margin">An admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> And it behooueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Gunner to beware of ſuch gunpowder, becauſe if it doe lie long dry in a peece, it will waxe ſo fine with long and dry lying, that if you take it not out of the peece, it will in his diſcharge with fire put the ſame peece in danger of breaking.</p>
                  <p>If ſmall black knottes (which will burne downwards in the place where proofe is made) ſhall remayne after gunpowder is ſet on a fire, they doe ſhewe that the ſame ſorte of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder hath not enough of the maiſter, and that it is of little force or ſtrength and ſlowe in fiering.</p>
                  <p>If a little heape of gunpowder ſet in a fire doth make a noyſe, riſe vp with great ſpeede, and yeelde little ſmoke, it is a ſigne that the ſaltpeeter in that heape of gunpowder was well refined, and well wrought, and that the materials in the ſayde heape were well incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated.</p>
                  <p>If the flame of fiered gunpowder ſhall riſe vp ſlowly, continue long, make little noyſe, &amp; yeelde much ſmoke, it is a ſigne that the ſame gunpowder had in it much cole &amp; brimſton, and a little quantitie of ſaltpeeter.</p>
                  <p>If gunpowder burned vppon a boorde ſhall black the ſame boorde, it is a ſigne that too much cole was in the ſame gunpowder.</p>
                  <p>When gunpowder is moyſte, or full of the earth of ſaltpeeter, it is naught for to be ſhot out of great ordinance, becauſe it putteth him in perill which ſhooteth with the ſame, &amp; in time of neede, ſhaming the Gunner which doth occupie it, ſerueth to no effect.</p>
                  <p>If gunpowder be very black, it is a ſigne that it was made with very much cole, or that it is moyſte, and when you rubbe it vppon a peece of white paper, it will black the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per more than it ſhould doe.</p>
                  <p>Among many ſortes of gunpowder to know which ſorte is beſt, make a little heape of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſorte of gunpowder, and then ſetting thoſe heapes one from another, marke well when you put fire vnto them which of the heapes did ſooneſt take fire: For that ſorte of gunpowder which will ſooneſt be a fire, make leaſt ſmoke, &amp; leaue leaſt refuſe, is the beſt gunpowder.</p>

I doe peruſe my memoriall, &amp; finding there that a pellet of yron of fiue ynches &amp; 299/413 of an ynche in diameter doth waye 27 pounds in auer de poyze waight,<note place="margin">The qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tities compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are called the termes of the proportion, &amp; in ſome writers the firſt terme namely, that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared is called the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent whether it be equall, greater, or leſſe than the other: and the ſecond terme namely that whereunto the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is made, is called the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.

                  <p>EVery great Peece of artillerie hath trunnions for thre cauſes, of which the firſt is to hold vp the Peece vppon his carriage, the ſecond is to make a Peece when it reſteth vppon them in his carriage to moue eaſilie vp and downe, and at the will of the Gunner to lie ſometimes leuell, and ſometimes mounted: And the thirde cauſe is, that they ſet in their due places, and well laid vppon a fit carriage, wil make their Peece in his diſcharge to lie faſt and ſteadie without any mouing forwardes, or backwards, downeward, or towardes any ſide, wherein the whole inportance of the ſhoote doth reſt. When the trunnions of a Peece are ſet to high, that is to ſay, more nearer to the mouth of their Peece tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould be, then the Peece in which the trunnions are ſo ſet will be ſo heauie at his taile, as that the Gunner ſhall not without great paine and ſtrength lift it vp. And when the trunnions of a peece ſhall be ſet too loe, that is to ſay more nearer to the touchhole than they ſhould be, then the mouth of their Peece (by meanes of the vnequall and great waight which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſaid mouth and the ſaid trunnions) will in his diſcharge fall downe towards the ground, wherefore I will not wrap vp here in ſilence the rules by which gunfounders may alwaies ſet the trunnions of euery great Peece in their due places.</p>
                  <p>Diuide the length of the Peece into ſeuen equall partes, and in the third part meaſured from the touchhole towards the mouth of the Peece ſet the trunnions ſo as ⅔ partes of the circumference of the Peece in that place where the trunnions ſhall be ſet, may bee ſeene aboue vppon, the Peece betweene the two trunnions. Alſo a Gunfounder skilfull in the arte of numbring, may by the helpe of the golden rule ſet the trunnions of euery great Peece in their due places after this maner: hee may multiplie the length of the Peece in which the trunnions ſhall be ſet by three, and hauing diuided the product thereof by ſeuen note the quotient number for the meaſure of the ſpace between the loeſt end of the peece his concauitie and the place where the trunnions muſt be ſet: As for example if a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder would know in what part of a peece which is 144 ynches in length the trunnions of the ſame Peece ſhould be ſet, he muſt multiplie 144 the length of the Peece by three, whereof will come 432 which diuided by ſeuen yeeldeth in the quotient 61 ynches and 5/7 of an ynch for the ſpace betweene the loeſt end of that peece his concauitie and the place where the trunnions of the ſame Peece ought to ſtand.</p>

                  <head>The 45 Chapter.

                  <p>VVRite firſt in your memoriall that 80 men may drawe a Peece of artillerie waying eight thouſand poundes in waight, and that ſixe horſes may drawe a peece of 860 poundes in waight, and that ſixe oxen may drawe a peece of Artillerie waying 1058 poundes in waight, and afterwardes if you ſhall be asked what number of men will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to drawe any Peece of Artillerie, multiplie the waight of the Peece by which the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is asked in 80 the number of men that will ſuffice (as you haue noted in your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall) to drawe a peece of eight thouſand poundes in waight, and deuide the product thereof by eight thouſand the waight of the Peece which 80 men may drawe, and ſo the quotient will ſhew the number of men that will ſuffice to drawe the peece of which the queſtion was asked. As for example it ſhall be ſuppoſed that this queſtion is asked, what number of men will ſuffice to drawe a peece waying 860 poundes in waight? To aunſwere the ſame queſtion, I multiplie 860 the waight of the Peece by which the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was asked in 80 the number of men which (as I haue noted in my memoriall) will ſuffice to drawe a peece of eight thouſande poundes in waight, and thereof commeth 68800 which I deuide by the ſaid number of eight thouſand the waight of the Peece which (as my memorial doth record) may bee drawne with foureſcore men, and ſo the quotient yeeldeth eight (leauing out the fraction which remaineth) for the number of men that wil<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1872:69"/>ſuffice to drawe the ſame peece of 860 poundes in waight, which by reduction maketh ſeuen hundred waight, ½ hundred waight, and twentie poundes of Auer de poize waight of England. Alſo let it be ſuppoſed that I am required to to tell what number of oxen will ſuffice to drawe the ſaide peece waying 860 poundes in waight? For to aunſwere this queſtion I peruſe my memoriall and finding there that ſixe Oxen will ſuffice to drawe a peece of 1058 poundes in waight, I multiplie 860 the waight of the peece by which the queſtion was asked, in ſixe the number of oxen which will ſuffice to draw the ſaid peece of 1058 poundes in waight, and ſo the product thereof is 5160, and then diuiding the ſaid produced number videlicet
5160 by 1058 the waight of the peece which ſixe oxen will draw I finde in the quotient foure (leauing out the fraction which remaineth) for the number of oxen which will ſuffice to drawe a peece of 860 poundes in waight. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if I ſhould be required to tell what number of horſes will ſuffice to draw a peece of 1800 poundes in waight, I would multiplie 1800 the waight of the peece by which the queſtion is asked in ſixe the number of horſes (which as I am inſtructed by my ſaid memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall will ſuffice to draw a peece of 860 poundes in waight) and diuide the product ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the ſaid number of 860, and take the quotient thereof which is twelue (leauing out the remaining fraction) for the number of horſes which will ſuffice to draw the ſaid peece of 1800 poundes in waight.</p>
                  <p>After this maner (leauing out alwaies the fraction which ſhall remaine, becauſe it is not to be reckoned in an anſwere to a queſtion concerning the number of men, horſes, or ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en which will ſuffice to drawe a peece of artillerie) you may tell what number of men, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or oxen will ſuffice to drawe any peece of artillerie whatſoeuer, what number of men will in drawing counteruaile any number of horſes, or oxen, and what number of horſes will in drawing counteruaile any number of oxen.</p>

For the line L M which lyeth along vppon that peece of ground (by the 33 propoſition of the firſt booke of <hi>Euclide</hi>) is equidiſtant to the line O N which goeth by the plane of the Horizon, and conſequently the ſaid peece of ground or platfourme vppon which the ſaid line L M goeth is equidiſtant (by the foureteenth propoſition of the eleuenth booke of <hi>Euclide</hi>) to the plane of the Horizon.

                  <head>The 60 Chapter. How the poynt blanke and vtmoſt ranges are proportionall in all peeces of Artillerie: How by the rule of proportion you may knowe what number of yardes any peece will reach at his vtmoſt randon: And how by the ſayd rule you may know what number of yardes any peece will reach at his poynte blanke.</head>
                  <p>THe poynt blanke and vtmoſt ranges (as ſome authors haue written) are proportionall in all peeces of Artillerie, wherefore knowing the poynt blanke and vtmoſt range of any one peece, and the poynt blanke of an other peece, you may tell the vtmoſt range of any that other peece. In like manner knowing the poynt blanke and vtmoſt range of any one peece, and the vtmoſt range of an other peece, you may tell the poynt blanke of that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peece: As for example let vs ſuppoſe that this queſtion is asked: If a Faucon carrying poynt blanke 320 yardes will at his vtmoſt randon range 1280 yardes: how farre will a Saker reach at his vtmoſt randon that at poynt blanke or leuel rangeth 360 yardes? I ſay, that the rule of proportion ſerueth preciſely to anſwere the ſame and all ſuch like queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, And that multiplying 360 in 1280, and diuiding 460800 the product thereof by
320, the quotient will yeelde 1440 for the number of yardes which the ſayd Saker ſhall reach at his vtmoſt randon. Againe, let vs ſuppoſe that I am required to anſwere this demaunde. If a Faucon which rangeth at his vtmoſt randon 1280 yardes will carrie poynt blanke 320 yardes, how farre will a Saker reach at poynte blanke that at his vtmoſt randon rangeth 1440 yardes? To doe that which is required I multiplie 320 in 1440, and hauing diuided
460800 the product by 1280. I finde in the quotient 360 to be the number of yards which the Saker will ſhoote leuel: or (as the Gunners terme is) poynt blanke. And thereuppon I conclude that after this manner by obſeruations vſed in any one peece of artillery, and by the arte of proportion I may diſcouer vnto you the force of all other peeces of artillerie.</p>

And by ſo doing if the peece be layd right vppon the marke, you ſhall vndoubtedly ſtrike the ſame.

                     <p>THere is a very thinne and burning licor with which if you will anointe in the cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer daies any wood or other thing apt to burn, you ſhal ſee that the heate of the ſun<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1872:89"/>without any other fire wil make the ſame anointed things to burn. Some ſay that <hi>Marcus Graccus</hi> deuiſed this fireworke to burne the Romanes Nauie, and it is alſo reported that if materiall fire be put into this kinde of oyntment it will ſodainlie burne, &amp; be vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, except it be choked with drie ſande, or wet with old and long kept vrine, or with very ſtrong vineger. Alſo this kinde of fireworke will burne in water, and as the ſaide <hi>Marcus Graccus</hi> writeth, it may thus be made. Take Camphire, oyle of quicke Brimſtone, oyle of Turpentine, oyle called in Italian <hi>Oglio Laterino,</hi> Iuniper oyle, Stone oyle oyle of Lynſeede, Alchitrean, Colophonia finely beaten, oyle of the yolkes of egges, ſhip pitch, Cera Zagora, Duckes greace ſtrained, Saltpeeter, and twiſe ſo much <hi>aqua vitae</hi> as all the compoſition, and ſo much of Arſinicke and Tartar as ⅛ part of the whole compoſition, and ſome Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacke ſalt, and hauing put all theſe things in an Alcumiſt pot or glaſſe well ſtopped with waxe, burie the ſaid pot or glaſſe (that the ſtuffe within the ſame may putrifie) in hot doung for the ſpace of two monethes. Then all the ſaid thinges being in a veſſell called Storta, which Alcumiſtes doe vſe, muſt bee diſtilled with a ſoft fire through which within ſixe or eight houres after the ſaid things haue been ouer the fire, there will come a very thinne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor, into which you muſt put ſo much pigens dung, or oxe dung dried in an ouen, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into verie fine powder, and ſearced, as will make of it a ſubſtance like ſope, or rather a more liquide thing,</p>
                     <p>This liquide mixture may thus bee vſed. Anoynt the thing which is to be burned with that liquide mixture, and (as it is ſaid) the heate of the Sunne in the Caniculer daies will ſet the ſame in a fire, ſo as it will not onely burne the annointed thing, but alſo euery other thing apt to take fire which is neare vnto it. <hi>Galen</hi> doth report that in <hi>Myſia</hi> which is a part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> the dung of a Pigen fell vppon a part of a woodden windoe painted with roſen, and that after the ſaide dung was drie, it did kindle with the heat of the Sunne, and burne not only the ſaid windoe, but alſo the whole houſe where that windoe was, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the dung of Pigens being drie, is apt and hath power to kindle fire.</p>

                  <p>Alſo you may make any nextinguiſhable torche in this maner: Take a long gunmatch, and after you haue boyled it in lie made of Saltpeeter, drie it well: then take of Brimſtone finely beaten 1 part, of gunpowder for great ordinance one part, &amp; of waxe one part: Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle al theſe things togeather, and when you haue melted this mixture in a pan, put ſo much of the ſaid gunmatch into it as will drinke or ſoke vp the greateſt part thereof: then taking the gunmatch out of the pan, cut it into peeces ſo long as the torch ſhall be, and vnto the quantity of mixture remaining in the pan, put a like quantity of the gumme of a pine tree, a like quantitie of Brimſtone, and a like quantitie of Turpentine. Which done, melt in that pan all the ſame things, and after you haue there well mingled them togeather, couer the ſaid peeces of a gunmatch all ouer with the ſame mixture, as waxe chaundelers doe vſe to couer their torch candles: and by ſo doing you ſhall make excellent torches, which bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a flame can not be extinguiſhed with winde, raine, or ſnoe.</p>

Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, ſturre the ſaid moyſte mixture well togeather, firſt with a ſtaffe, afterwardes with a ſpade or ſhouel, and make a heape thereof. When the ſaide mixture hath in that ſort byn well wrought, lay it vppon a boorde and moyſten it againe, and beate it with a ſpade or ſhouell till you haue beaten it enough, for the longer that you ſhall beate and moyſten it, the better it will be.</p>
                  <p>This kinde of clay is very good to lute or ſtoppe veſſels of glaſſe, and Fornaces, and to make thicke mouldes, and many other things.</p>
                  <p>If you will not beſtow all this labor to make <hi>Lutum ſapientiae,</hi> or lute of wiſdome, then take onely of the ſaide white chaulke, floxe, horſedung or aſſedung, and a few aſhes.

But to lute and ſtoppe the mouthes of glaſſes that no ayre may breathe out of them, ſuch lute of wiſdome as is made after the firſt order is beſt, eſpecially if two partes of vnſlaked lime, and ſo many whites of egges as ſhall ſeeme to bee enough, be added thereunto, for vnſlaked Lime and the whites of egges wil make it more ſure, and as harde as glaſſe, and by ſuch meanes the vente of ayre will bee the leſſe. Moreouer, this Lute of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muſt alwayes be kept in a moyſte place, but ſo as the ſaid Lute bee not kept too moyſte nor too drie, for the ſame being drie will waxe harde, and then it ſerues to no vſe,<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1872:99"/>and if you ſhall goe about to make it ſofte by caſting water vppon it, the outſide thereof will be moyſte and mollified therewith, but the inſide of the ſame will continue harde, wherefore when the lute of wiſdome is very harde, it is beſt for you to let it drie well, and afterwardes to beate it into fine powder, and then to make thereof againe lute of wiſdome in ſuch ſorte as before you were taught to doe.</p>

Alſo you muſt ſet the tung of the Stater Squirewiſe vppon the beame right ouer this ſeconde Axeltree, and put the cheekes of the tung vppon the endes of the ſeconde Axeltree, ſo as they may eaſilie mooue vp and downe vppon the ſame. And it is expedient that theſe cheekes ſhoulde haue in their vppermoſt ende a ringe or hooke by which the Stater may bee alwayes hanged vp when neede ſhall require. Next after this, you muſt lay in the ſcale of the Stater depending by ropes from the firſt Axeltree, ſo much of knowne waight as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reckoned with the waight of the ſcale and the waight of the ropes belonging to the Scale, will make both endes of the Beame to lie without any declyning in an equall heigth: Which is perceaued by the tung of the Stater when it doth ſtande right vp betweene his cheekes. Furthermore, to this waight which hath made both endes of the Beame to ſtande preciſely equidiſtant to the Horizon, and is ſuppoſed by me to contayne fiftie poundes, you ſhall adde tenne poundes of more wayght, and that being done, you ſhall hang a ringed poyze of tenne poundes in waight vppon that parte of the Beame which is marked in the Figure following with B F. Now the ſayde poyze hanged vppon B F the longer parte of the beame, muſt bee mooued to and fro vntill the tung of the Stater ſhall bee perceaued to ſtande very vpright beetweene his cheekes, to this ende that the parte of the Beame which is then tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the ring of the poyze may bee exactly marked with a ſmall notch or with a fine line. When you haue made there ſuch a notch or ſuch a lyne, lay tenne poundes of more wayght in the ſcale, and becauſe the tung of the Stater will now enclyne towardes A the greater ende of the beame, remooue the ſayde poyze to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes F, vntill the tung of the Stater ſtanding vpright betweene his cheekes, ſhall ſhewe agayne equalitie of wayght, and then as before you haue beene taught to doe, make an other notch, or drawe an other lyne vppon that part of the beame which is touched with the ringe of the poyze. For the ſpace betweene theſe two notches or lynes will exactly ſhewe a diſtinction and ſeparation of tenne poundes in wayght. Vnto which if you adde the firſt wayght which is ſuppoſed to bee fiftye, and the ſeconde wayght which was tenne, the totall ſumme of the whole wayght which the ringed poyze doeth counterpeyſe in the notch or lyne laſt made, amounteth to ſeuenty poundes.</p>
                  <p>Finally you muſt marke vppon the beame the ſpace that is betweene the two notches or lynes ſo manye tymes as the beame will receaue the ſame. For the notch or lyne in each of thoſe ſpaces is a diſtinction of tenne poundes in wayght, ſo that if you will diuide euery of thoſe equall ſpaces into tenne equall partes, and euery of theſe tenne equall partes, into ſixteene equall partes, the beame will not onely ſhewe the places of poundes in wayght, but alſo the place of euery ounce that is in each of the ſayde poundes.<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1872:100"/>For euery of thoſe equall ſpaces doe geue equall increaſe, and looke what proportion the ſuppoſed waight of 50 pounds (which made both endes of the beame to lie in an equall heigth) beareth to the ringed poyze, the ſame proportion doth B F the longer parte of the beame beare to A B the ſhorter parte of the beame: And becauſe B F the longer parte of the beame is twenty times ſo much in length as A B the ſhorter parte of the beame, and that the ringed poyze wayeth tenne poundes, multiplie 10 in 20, and thereof riſeth 200, vnto which adde the ſuppoſed waight of 50 poundes, which did make the beame to lie as a parallell with the Horizon before the ringed poyze was put on vppon the ſame, and ſo the product thereof will be 250, wherefore I conclude that this Stater with his ſaid ringed poyze of 10 poundes will ſhewe the true waight of any quantitie that doth not way aboue 250 poundes.</p>

As for example, if the line ſhall fall vppon twelue partes, diuide 72 by twelue, and the quotient to bee reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued will be ſixe. Afterwards remoouing your quadrant, marke the place of your ſtanding, and goe ſo farre as you liſt directly forwardes towardes the deſired altitude, or directlie backwardes from the ſame.

But to the end this kinde of menſuration may be the better vnderſtood, I will giue you an other example thereof which ſhall differ from the aforeſayde example, and in this example following I will ſuppoſe the ſide of the ſquare to be diuided only into twelue partes.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe againe that your firſt ſtanding is in the place marked with C, and that at the ſame ſtanding the ſaid line doth fall vppon the tenth parte of contrarie ſhadowe (as it doth in the figure following) and that at your ſecond ſtanding in the place marked with V, the ſaid line falleth vppon the eight part of contrary ſhadowe (as likewiſe it appeareth to doe in the ſaid figure) and that the ſpace betweene C and V containes 285 feete, and that from your eye to the grounde, that is to ſay from E to C or from X to V there are foure feete.

Then reſeruing this 1 and ⅕, go to your ſecond ſtanding where you ſhall finde the triangle X F A, to be like vnto the triangle L P Q of the ſeconde ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that ſo many times as the ſide P Q (which is eight partes of the ſcale of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhadowe) is in the ſide L Q (which is 12, the whole number of partes of one ſide of the ſcale) ſo many times the heigth A F is contained in the diſtance X F, and becauſe the ſide P Q (that is to ſay 8 parts) is contained once and ½ in the ſide L Q (that is to ſay in 12 partes) therefore the heigth A F is likewiſe contained once and ½ in the diſtance X F. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubtracting the diſtance E F from the diſtance X F (that is to ſay 1 and ⅕ from 1 and ½) there will remaine 3/10 for the difference E X, ſo as the ſaid difference E X wil be 3/10 of the ſaid heigth A F. And becauſe the ſaid difference E X is ſuch as is the line V C (by the 34 propoſition of the firſt booke of <hi>Euclide</hi>) and that the ſaid line V C is ſuppoſed to containe 285 feete, therefore it followeth that there are 285 feete in 3/10 of the heigth A F. By reaſon whereof the whole heigth of A F ſhould be 950 feete, as before hath been ſayd. Then ioyn 4 feete which is ſuppoſed to be the heigth of E C and of X V vnto the ſaid number of 950 feete, and ſo the totall ſumme thereof will be 954 feete which is the whole heigth of A B, becauſe the heigth of F B doth likewiſe containe 4 feete. And therefore as the ſide P Q of the firſt ſtanding is in proportion to the ſide or Hipothenuſal line L P, ſo is the heigth A F to the Hipothenuſall diſtance A E. And becauſe the ſide P Q is in proportion to the ſide or Hipothenuſall line L P (by the 47 propoſition of the firſt booke of <hi>Euclide</hi>) as 10 is to the nigheſt ſquare roote of 244 (which number of 244 is the ſumme that came by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſquare of 10 to the ſquare of 12) therefore multiplie 950 feete by 15 and
19/30 which is the nigheſt ſquare roote of 244 and diuide the product thereof by 10, and the quotient wil yeeld 1485 feete &amp; two ynches for the Hipothenuſall diſtance A E. And forſomuch as the diſtance betweene E and F is ſo much as the heigth of A F and ⅕ parte more (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been prooued) therefore take ⅕ of the heigth A F that is to ſay ⅕ parte of 950 feete which is 190 and adde the ſame ſumme of 190 to the ſumme of 950 feete the heigth of A F and thereof will come 1140 feet which ſheweth what number of feete are in the Horizontall diſtance that is to ſay betweene E and F and betweene C and B.</p>
                  <p>And in like ſort you muſt proceede to finde out at the ſecond ſtanding the Hipothenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall diſtance betweene X and A,<note place="margin">An admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and the Horizontall diſtance betweene X F, but it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth you to note in this kinde of menſurations by two ſtandinges, that ſometimes your eye in one ſtanding will not be ſo high from the grounde as it will be in the other ſtanding, eſpecially when your Inſtrument hangs vpon a thing that ſtandes faſt in the ground. And although that difference is but little, yet many times the ſame will breede great errors, and therefore to auoyd the occaſion of ſuch errors, I exhort you to prouide a line and plummet which may reache from the center of the quadrant to the grounde, and direct you at your firſt ſtanding and alſo at your ſecond ſtanding. Moreouer to auoyde errors, I counſell you to hang your Quadrant ſo as it may turne vppon no other part thereof then vppon his center, but nowe to returne vnto our purpoſe, if by chaunce you ſhall ſtande ſo neare vnto the altitude as that the line and plummet of the quadrant falleth vppon the right ſhadow, you muſt work otherwiſe than you did before, I meane you muſt diuide thoſe parts cut with the ſaid line by
12, &amp; in this caſe the quotient muſt alwaies bee ſet downe like a fraction, the which fraction you muſt reſerue, and after you haue marked the place<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1872:106"/>where you ſtoode, goe from thence ſo farre as you liſt in a right line forwardes or backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and then placing your ſaide Inſtrument againe as you did at your firſt ſtanding, lift the ſaid Inſtrument vppe or put it down, till you may through his ſights ſee A the top of the altitude. This done, note aduiſedly vppon what part of right ſhadowe the ſaide line and plummet falleth, and that part diuide by twelue (the whole number of partes of one ſide of the ſcale) and the quotient thereof muſt of neceſsitie bee ſet downe like a fraction: This fraction ſubtract from the other fraction firſt reſerued, or in plainer words, ſubtract the leſſer of thoſe two fractions from the greater, and reſerue the remainder thereof. Then meaſure the ſpace between your firſt and ſecond ſtanding by feete, paces, or any other kind of meaſure that you will, and diuide the number of that meaſure by the remainder which was before reſerued, and adde vnto the quotient of the ſaide diuiſion the heigth betweene the center of the ſaid Inſtrument and the ground, and by ſo doing you may conclude that the totall ſumme thereof is the altitude of the thing ſeene.</p>
                  <p>For an example hereof, if at the firſt ſtanding the ſayd line and plummet ſhall fall vppon the thirde parte of right ſhadowe, diuide that number of three by twelue (the whole number of partes in one ſide of the ſcale) and the quotient thereof will bee in a fraction ¼. Reſerue this fraction of ¼, and then marke your firſt ſtanding with a ſtaffe ſet vpright vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the center of your Inſtrument and then goe from thence backwardes in a right line ſo farre as you liſt, and placing there your Inſtrument as you did at your firſt ſtanding, mooue it vp or down till you ſhall againe eſpie through the ſaid ſightes A the toppe of the ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Then looke vppon what part of right ſhadowe the ſaid line and plummet falleth, as if by chaunce it fell vppon the fourth part, diuide that fourth by twelue, and the quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent wil be in a fraction ⅓. Nowe out of ¼ the fraction which was before reſerued, ſubtract the laſt quotient which was ⅓ and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The demonſtration of this worke is to be made by the ſimilitude of triangles and their proportionall ſides as before the other demonſtration hath been made.</p>
                  <p>In this kinde of menſurations by two ſtandings, you muſt be very circumſpect that the ſtaffe vppon which your quadrant ſhall hang doe ſtande plumbe vpright both at your firſt ſtanding, and alſo at your ſeconde ſtanding.

                  <p>TO drawe a platte of any peece of ground, prepare an Inſtrument made of mettall, or of Cypreſſe wood like vnto the Figure following. And after you haue ſet it flatte and leuel vppon a foote, or vpon a ſtoole in an high place from whence you may ſee round about many other notable places,<note place="margin">Note that the variation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery compaſſe in England is 11 degrees &amp; ¼ of a degree, and that for the ſame cauſe in euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe within England, the North poynte lyeth directly againſt the North pole, &amp; the South poynt lieth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the South pole, when the needle of the compaſſe doth ſtande directly ouer the north and by Eaſt, &amp; South and by Weſt points in the compaſſe.</note> turne this Inſtrument named a Geographicall playne Sphere to and fro vppon his foote, or for lacke of a foote, vppon a ſtoole, till by the ayde of his needle you haue made all his Semidiameters to pointe vnto their proper quarters. This done, the Inſtrument remayning ſtedfaſt, direct the Index with his two ſights to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place that ſhall be ſet foorth in your platte, taking your markes through the ſaid ſights in the middeſt of euery of them, and note in a Table by it ſelfe the degrees cutte with the ſaid Index in the Circle, which may be called the Angles of poſition, or Angles of ſight, and ſo make a table of your firſt ſtation. Then remoouing your Inſtrument to one of the higheſt places noted in your ſaide Table, pitch your Inſtrument in the high place which you haue choſen for your ſeconde ſtation in all reſpects as you did at your firſt ſtation, and turning the ſaide Index ſo as you may ſee through his ſightes all the places which you did ſee before at your firſt ſtation, Note againe in an other Table the Angles of poſition, or Angles of ſightes, writing the name of euery place and his Angle of ſight by it. After this, at your comming home lay a protractor (which is a circle made of wood or mettalle, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into 360 equall partes like vnto C D the Figure following) vppon a ſheete of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and making a prick thoroe the center of the ſaide protractor in the ſaide paper, which prick ſhall repreſent the place of your firſt ſtation, write with a cole at the edge of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor by euery degree or Angle of ſight his place, and then laying your protractor aſide, drawe with a cole ſtraight lines from the ſaide prick which repreſenteth your firſt ſtation vnto the places ſo noted. Againe putting the center of your protractor right ouer the line which pointeth from your firſt ſtation vnto your ſecond ſtation, and hauing regard to place the prick of your ſecond ſtation from the prick of the firſt ſtation, ſo as the croſsing of like lines may be within the compaſſe of your ſaid paper, turne the protractor to and fro kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his center vppon the ſaid line, till it doe lie in euery reſpect as it did vppon the pricke of your firſt ſtation, and when you haue ſo done, make thoroe the center of the protractor in the ſaid line a prick, which muſt repreſent the place of your ſecond ſtation, &amp; write with a cole as you did before at the edge of the protractor by euery degree or Angle of ſight his place. After this taking vp the protractor from the paper, draw with a cole ſtraight lines from the pricke of your ſeconde ſtation vnto the noted places, and looking diligently<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1872:110"/>vppon the croſsing of euery two like lines, write thereon a figure, ſtarre, or other ſigne, and the name of his place. Now to know how farre euery place is diſtant from other, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by your Inſtrument, or by a wier line the diſtance betweene your two ſtations, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the right line in your paper betweene the pricke of your firſt ſtation and the prick of your ſecond ſtation, into ſo many equall partes as there are feete, yardes, paſes, or perches betweene your two ſtations, and then opening your compaſſe to one of thoſe partes, you may meaſure from place to place, and ſay that there are ſo many feete, yardes, paſes, or perches (according to the denomination of that one parte whereunto you open your Compaſſe) as you finde partes.</p>
                  <p>Example.</p>
                  <p>Purpoſing to drawe the platte of a peece of ground which hath vppon it a Beacon, a Tower, a houſe, a church, a windmill, a hill and a mount, I doe firſt ſet my Geographicall plaine Sphere in all reſpectes according to the precepts before declared vpon the hill from whence I may ſee al the aforeſaide places, and then by turning the Index of my Inſtrument to euery of thoſe places, I finde that it cutteh at the middell parte of the Beacon, 80 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, at the middle parte of the Tower 95 degrees, at the middle parte of the houſe 110 degrees, at the middle parte of the church 130 degrees and ⅔ of a degree, at the middle parte of the windemill 155 degrees and ½ of a degree, and at that parte of the mount where I will make my ſecond ſtation 180 degrees, whereuppon I make a table of my firſt ſtation after this manner.

                  <p>Moreouer, I doe lay my portractor vppon a ſheete of paper, and hauing made a pricke in the ſame paper with the poynt of a needle thruſt thorow a little hole in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame protractor, I make a poynte with a cole in the edge of the protractor at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree and parte of a degree noted in the table of my firſt ſtation, and then taking my protractor vp from the paper, doe drawe ſtraight lines vnto euery of thoſe points, &amp; write with a cole their names.
